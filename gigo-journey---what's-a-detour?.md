# GIGO Journey - What's a Detour?

Learning to code from non-traditional education sources is exploding in popularity. GIGO Dev innovates the developer learning process by lowering the barrier to entry in terms of price and accessibility (pre-configured IDE), structuring the learning process in an engaging manner, and integrating AI across its platform to ensure the most optimal use of your time.

**The Superior place to learn to code**

GIGO Dev was created by a team of self-taught programmers who wanted to ease the friction of the self-taught path for other prospective coders and experienced devs alike. This led to the creation of Journeys.

Journeys are designed to take users from zero to full understanding of programming concepts as quickly as possible. They offer structure for new and experienced programmers to improve their programming skills

**Learning to code with Journeys**

Your Journey is a collection of [Bytes](https://medium.com/@gigo_dev/what-are-bytes-in-gigo-8a9a58ae744f) called Units that are tailored towards grasping the building blocks of the overarching concept you want to learn.

After each completed section, the GIGO Dev platform assesses where you’re at in your current journey and offers recommended units to add to your Journey map.

However, as you complete Bytes and expand your knowledge-base its natural for the topics you’re interested in to increase. You should have the ability to personally add new concepts to your Journey on demand.

**Journey Detours**

Detours are your ability to add units to your Journey for concepts that have piqued your interest. They are there to give the user more control over their curriculum.

The process to add a detour is simple. Navigate to the Journey Detours page and select the Unit concept that catches your attention. When you’ve selected your desired Detour the Unit map will pop up giving you an idea of how comprehensive the unit will be.

When you’re decided, select “Take Detour” and the unit will be added to your Journey roadmap. Take control of your learning process and make the most of your time with GIGO Dev

**GIGO Dev is the best place to learn to code**

Journeys are designed to provide structure for new and experienced programmers to gain full understanding of programming concepts as quickly as possible.

Having a properly structured path when learning to code will ensure you stay consistent and motivated.
