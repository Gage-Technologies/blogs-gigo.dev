In October of 2023 the first iteration of GIGO Dev was released to the world. At the time, the platform was tailored to be a candy land for aspiring & experienced programmers to learn new concepts and compete with their friends. While the “game” element of GIGO is still present, the platform has morphed into something more refined, poised to revolutionize online learning.

**Where GIGO started** 

At beta release, the platform consisted strictly of “Projects”. The experience tailored fully towards desktop users.

When we consider the path of the average self taught developer its easy to see where GIGO fits in. Our aspiring programmer takes to an online course, most likely from codecademy. But where then does our hero turn after completion of their online course? We found the answer to this fundamental question to simply be “their first project”.

Thus the inspiration for release became a catalogue of projects, with an online, pre-configured IDE that requires no setup for the novice learner.

Elements of direct competition were introduced, such as the “Nemesis” program. Aka the ability to challenge and compete with friends on the platform for bragging rights, among other things.

At this time the team heavily encouraged users to create their own projects with the vision of a thriving community around the corner.

Our lead dev came forth with a proclamation, the words of Tony Fadell ringing in his ears; before we become a thriving platform, we need to build an amazing product.

This declaration was powerful, thrusting the development team into a new era of creativity driven by the desire to build something truly worth using.

**Building thru Beta**

The platform continues to gain new users every day. Some take advantage of the premium features, others continue to return using the free version. One consistent factor remains — momentum. The platform grows in functionality as it does in users.

The objective to become a well rounded product led to the introduction of new functionality and emphasis on accelerating learning. The largest focus initially being “Code Teacher”. Having a catalogue of projects is helpful, having an educated assistant to guide you thru the sticking points is powerful.

The introduction of “Bytes” was a turning point in the platform. The concept being bite-sized (5–15 minute) programming tasks with adjustable difficulty levels to lower the bar of commitment and maximize the dopamine feedback loop for new users.

Bytes also forced the team to catch the mobile experience up with desktop. Obviously programming on a mobile device is never going to be ideal. Bytes, with their pre-configured IDE and Code Teacher AI learning assistant, at the very least put a cherry on top of the poor experience of coding on your phone. Give it a try yourself and let us know what you think.

Let’s see how Bytes fit into the larger picture of GIGO Dev realizing their goal to become a new-age learning platform.

**Approaching GIGO Dev’s official release**

So we have a catalogue of full “Projects”, and we have a catalogue of smaller “Bytes”, now lets make ’em kiss.

Introducing the GIGO Dev Journey Experience. Assessment of institutional education merits a reasonable platform adjustment: course structure. The idea behind a Journey is to arrive at true programming familiarity with a concept or language.

Journeys are not your basic 101 Python course where you’re meticulously dragged thru syntax memorization drills. Journeys are custom to each user dependent on their goals and programming objectives. Journeys are also free.

Each Journey is comprised of multiple Bytes, where upon completion they will be met with a full project akin to a unit test. When a unit is completed, users can continue down the path or opt for a “detour”.

Now that they have a better grasp on the initial concept they were interested in learning, detours provide an opportunity to broaden their curriculum.

All the while as the user walks this path, they are guided by Code Teacher.

**Current state of affairs**

GIGO Dev is still in their Beta version. The combination of projects, bytes, pre-configured IDE’s, Code Teacher and the upcoming GIGO Homework Cheater position the platform as a truly competitive learn to code product.

When you buy into GIGO, you don’t just get 24/7 help on your homework assignments, projects and general programming questions. When you buy into GIGO, you receive a custom path and curriculum to gain real life development experience, achieving true familiarity with your desired topic.
