GIGO Dev provides structured learning for new and experienced programmers to improve their programming skills.

Pre-configured IDE’s encourage new users to try things that would take them hours or days to set up, instead they are programming in minutes. This accessibility lets learners try, fail and succeed to obtain experience more quickly.

Combine this accessibility with structured learning and GIGO Dev’s AI powered platform accelerates the learning process bringing beginner coders up to speed more quickly than any other learn to code offer available online.

Let’s step off the beaten path and learn how Journeys can help you reach your coding goals.

**Learning to program**

It’s important to build a strong foundation when learning programming. Thinking about things in terms of architecture, organization, and survival skills is extremely beneficial.

Finding a course (or even simply reading wikipedia) on computer structure will enlighten you to many of the early decisions made for programming languages. This fundamental understanding is the first step to your application of logic in computer programming.

What differentiates a novice from a veteran programmer is how they organize their code. Once you familiarize yourself with this structure, reading and understanding code becomes much more simple. To become part of the club, you must understand their written and unwritten rules.

Survival skills can be alternatively defined as research skills. Easily the most important skill a programmer can have is mastering Google to find their answer. This instills a sense of self-sufficiency, an extremely desirable trait for programmers to have.

Understanding your problem to the best of your ability and using forums like StackOverflow are extremely helpful for diagnosing and assessing problems.

All these aspects were considered in the development of Journeys. The platform is designed to teach common sense programmer fundamentals as well as proper code structure & research skills by setting an inquisitive environment with access to a knowledge base via text interface with Code Teacher.

**What are Journeys in GIGO?**

Journeys are the quickest way to reach proficiency in a desired coding subject. Learning to code can be overwhelming.

Journeys provide structure and tools to prospective coders delivering an expedited path to becoming a respectable programmer.

**Learning to code with Journeys**

Your Journey is a collection of Bytes called Units that are tailored towards grasping the building blocks of the overarching concept you want to learn. Here’s a top down view of what Journeys look like.

After completing a multitude of Bytes and ultimately finishing your unit, new units are able to be added to your Journey.

The GIGO platform is integrated with AI that understands your goal and the steps you’ve completed in your Journey. This means we can make intelligent recommendations for additional units.

However, as you complete Bytes and expand your knowledge-base its natural for the topics you’re interested in to expand. You should have the ability to personally add new concepts to your Journey on demand.

We call these Detours, Detours are your ability to add interesting units to your Journey.
