# Learn To Code - GIGO Projects

It’s important to build a strong foundation when learning programming. Thinking about things in terms of architecture, organization, and survival skills is extremely beneficial.

Finding a course (or even simply reading wikipedia) on computer structure will enlighten you to many of the early decisions made for programming languages. This fundamental understanding is the first step to your application of logic in computer programming.

What differentiates a novice from a veteran programmer is how they organize their code. Once you familiarize yourself with this structure, reading and understanding code becomes much more simple. To become part of the club, you must understand their written and unwritten rules.

Survival skills can be alternatively defined as research skills. Easily the most important skill a programmer can have is mastering Google to find their answer. Understanding your problem to the best of your ability and using forums like StackOverflow are extremely helpful for diagnosing and assessing problems.

**What are GIGO Projects?**

Projects in GIGO are real-world coding challenges that teach individuals to apply their coding skills to solve practical problems.

These projects are designed to align with the interests of aspiring developers and cover a wide range of topics, including web development, game development, data science, basic language syntax and more.

Each project comes with a set of instructions, resources, and a pre-configured IDE to help novice programmers get started quickly.

They provide an opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, which helps to reinforce learning and build practical skills.

**How do Projects in GIGO Work?**

Projects in GIGO are designed to be easy to use and accessible to individuals of all skill levels. To get started, simply browse the repository of projects and select one that aligns with your interests. For example, below is a snapshot of the introduction to Golang project.

When you launch a project you’ll be taken to the Devspace launch screen. The wait time is dependent on the size of your project and is the IDE virtual environment spinning up.

Play 2048 while you wait for your Devspace to initialize.

When its ready, hit Enter Devspace to get started:

A major benefit of learning on GIGO is that the platform offers pre-configured IDEs allowing novice programmers to start their learning journey without having to set up their own IDE.

Once you have selected a project, you can start working on it within minutes. The IDE comes with all the necessary tools and resources to complete the project, including a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Additionally, the IDE provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help you improve your code and solve the problem more efficiently.

These benefits are available due to Code Teacher’s deep integration with the platform, understanding the code you’re working on gives the system unique insight to increase performance and make recommendations.

**Code Teacher in GIGO Dev**

Code Teacher is the pillar of GIGO’s learn to code platform. Serving as a private tutor capable of conversational guidance throughout the learning process, Code Teacher gives suggestions for next steps, Debugging support, and Code Clean Up to help prospective coders learn real life development skills.

Code Teacher acts as a personal programming tutor, improving your ability to absorb and retain important information while learning to code like a developer.

This early stage introduction to AI tools builds familiarity in prospective coders leading to higher levels of confidence when put into situations where they don't know whats going on.

**Combining Projects and Code Teacher**

Built by self-taught devs — for self taught devs. Code Teacher is the brain child of a team of programmers who wish they had more support during the early days of their learning journey.

It was natural to combine this useful tool with a collection of projects and programming tasks to achieve the ultimate goal of greater efficiency in less time.

Projects are an essential part of the learning process for aspiring developers. GIGO provides a large repository of projects to help individuals build practical skills and showcase their abilities. With pre-configured IDEs and real-world coding challenges, GIGO is the best place to learn to code.

Whether you are just starting your coding journey or looking to build your skills, GIGO has a project that aligns with your interests.

Start exploring the repository of projects on GIGO today and take the first step towards becoming a skilled developer.
