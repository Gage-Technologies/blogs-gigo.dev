The entire foundation of our knowledge is the result of compounding historical record passed from generation to generation culminating in the [thinking rocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6jz6l1/cpus/djibn7m/?context=3) revolution. Communication — now brought to you by artificial intelligence.

Whether it be articles for marketing, storytelling for creatives, or self-improvement seeking perfectionists — that rough zig-zagging path can now be smoothed out with help from the machine.

Wordtune Spices can generate sentences or whole paragraphs in tune with whatever the user is writing. VentureBeat compared it with AI-powered Grammarly while The NY Times and some other media called Wordtune a rival to [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT).

### Niche AI Audio Applications

In our world people use tools to assist in completion of their objective. We use hammers instead of fists, but the hammer simply cannot replace the human element. AI does not always follow this formula.

Sometimes AI is used as a tool to assist humans while other times the final product replaces the need for a person altogether. Here we take a look at how niche AI Audio applications support both of these paths.

[**Lovo**](https://lovo.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3264/1*Dh6KK5SLJrKWmni7zf8a8g.png)

Lovo is an award-winning AI Voice Generator and text to speech software with 500+ voices in 100 languages. The organization offers a variety of AI based services including art generation, script generation, text-to-speech, voice cloning and general voice generation. But where they really shine as a unique offer in my opinion is their hyper realistic voice generation.

This AI-powered solution **eliminates the need for expensive voice talent**, as it can generate realistic voices in a fraction of the time and cost. It features a library of 500+ voices with various styles, granular voice control, sound effects and music, and voices capable of expressing up to 25+ emotions.

With LOVO, users can create explainer videos, podcasts, social media content, and e-learning materials with ease. It also comes with an intuitive, yet full-featured UI that makes it easy for users to access all of its features.

Founded in January of 2019 by [Tom Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomsklee/) (COO) and [Charlie Choi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliechoi/) (CEO/Wizard), the company has had an impressive series of raises positioning themselves as the go to voice and synthetic speech tool of the future.

Founded in 2022 by “best friends” [Piotr Dabkowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-dabkowski-50222bba/overlay/about-this-profile/) and [Mati Staniszewski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiii/overlay/about-this-profile/), ElevenLabs came out swinging with a successful demo and release.

Their mission is to make audio content universally accessible in any language. To accomplish this, they’ve researched new methods for voice generation that preserve the distinctive features of speech — like emotions, intonation and intent — across languages.

Inspired by the ‘poor’ dubbing of Hollywood movies they watched growing up in their native Poland, the pair set about designing a platform which could eliminate the linguistic barriers of content.

Enter “Speech to Speech” technology. Here is where they shine on making their childhood dreams come true. The recently released AI dubbing tool gives users the ability to automatically re-voice any audio or video in a different language, all while preserving the original speaker’s voice.

Their research powers the platform’s current features but it also contributes to realizing their ultimate goal of **instantly converting spoken audio between languages**. How fucking cool is that?

[**Songburst**](https://www.songburst.ai/)

### Niche AI Design Applications

Professional photographers don’t get enough credit for just how difficult capturing the perfect shot is. Most will tell you the magic happens when its time to edit the moments they’ve encapsulated through lens.

Whether it be consumer packaged goods, people, food or large objects, there is an inherit need to automate the monotonous tasks required to bring a picture from moment captured to professionally presentable material. Let’s explore some of the unique AI applications that do exactly that, among other design oriented tasks.

[**Flair.ai**](https://flair.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2586/1*3fXPmfmc-w7IlR2PVMK4jg.png)

Flair ai addresses a very unique sector of product advertising. Most of us have probably seen a behind the scenes video of [how food advertisements are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=d7iSFl5cp84). Ever wonder how food commercials look so mouthwatering and perfect? A huge portion of this is the stage the photographers set.

In the world of packaged goods and consumer products, teams of artistic individuals work to ensure the “stage” is set for their product. Flair reduces cost and time to set the stage by leveraging AI to mix & match product placement across a variety of templates.

Drag and drop images, props, and 3D assets. Adjust the lighting and camera angle to compose the perfect scene. This AI application **accelerates an organization’s ability to test design concepts**.

Founded in late 2022 by [Mickey Friedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickey-friedman-93532b99/) and [Antonio Cao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-cao-4baab5156/), if you are looking to generate high-end product photography in minutes for CPG and Beauty Brands, check out this AI design tool for branded content.

[**Designify**](https://www.designify.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3340/1*M6FHEL5cq-WWdPYR_a9iig.png)

Designify is Artificial Intelligence for design. They claim to combine the world’s most advanced visual AIs into one simple tool. Users have the ability to remove backgrounds from any image in high quality, add realistic shadows and enhance colors to create beautiful designs.

Designify, a division of [Kaleido AI](https://www.kaleido.ai/), which was acquired by Canva in 2021 for what has been theorized as close to $100M, is re-imagining AI powered design tools. Kaleido was founded in 2017 by [Benjamin Groessing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/begroe/) (CEO) and [David Fankhauser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-fankhauser-221994138/) (CTO), both of whom still carry their Kaleido responsibilities as well as roles in their acquirer Canva.

Honestly the service looks pretty cool. **Users can upload generic images of a product (such as a watch in its case) and replace the background with a professional presenting aesthetic**. The same can be accomplished with images of people or larger objects such as motor vehicles. From there, their in-suite editor allows for customization such as adding logos, shadow adjustments and more.

[**ClipDrop**](https://clipdrop.co/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZmlGUwmp8dPHpSGjQz2KtA.png)

ClipDrop is a Paris based company founded in 2020 by [Cyril Diagne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrildiagne/) (CEO), [Jonathan Blanchet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanblanchet/) (former CTO) and [Damien Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damien-henry-82a16a7/) (COO). Better known as Init ML (ClipDrop parent company), they were acquired by Stability AI in 2023. They offer a variety of design-based services that **turn mobile photos into professional product visuals**.

Thanks to companies like Poshmark, Etsy and eBay, there are now over 30M sellers who need great visuals for their shops but most of them don’t have access to a professional photographer or a design team.

![ClipDrop Differentiation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*EzbITsQqd21WaoSFaNQBig.png)

ClipDrop reduces friction in the design process with a multitude of AI based tools at their client’s disposal. Among other things, you can swap model faces, replace or remove backgrounds and leverage Stable Diffusion for a variety of tasks.

What stands out to me is their ability to upscale image quality. Having the ability to take an image and manipulate the tone, lighting and reduce fuzzy pixels means photographers can get more out of each picture.

There is [an excellent article](https://clipdrop.co/blog/relight-photo-studio) on their blog that highlights some of the unique things this AI backed solution can accomplish with ease.

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3338/1*_5er88VlrYIp7s4lnNMapw.png)

If you’ve ever found yourself googling, “free AI image generator” then you’re likely to have come across Canva (kudos — Canva marketing team).

For the hopeless romantics in the tech world, Melanie & Cliff got married almost a decade after launch. Looking for love? Start a company with your ideal partner and raise the valuation to $20B+ over a decade of hard work, easy peasy, problem solved.

### Niche AI Research Assistant Applications

The days of tearing thru books in the library and physical research papers is mostly phased out, but the days of sorting thru practically infinite pages on the internet for your answers is in full stride.

Having an AI application to sort the mess and deliver your desired key points, summarized, to the top of the pile will soon be looked at as a necessity during the research process.

[**Perplexity**](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3338/1*YeOApXu0GtUUh_6zdEcgpw.png)

Perplexity is the worlds first conversational answer engine and research companion. Instead of entering keywords and sorting through a tangle of links, **users pose their questions directly to Perplexity.ai and receive concise, accurate answers backed up by a curated set of sources.**

The organization hit the ground running in August 2022 led by co-founders [Aravind Srinivas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind-srinivas-16051987/) (CEO) and [Denis Yarats](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisyarats/) (CTO).

Their mission is to build the world’s best answer engine — one that people trust to discover and expand their knowledge. To achieve this, they are deeply focused on providing helpful, factual, and up-to-date information.

To benchmark their LLMs’ performance on these axes, they curated evaluation datasets to reflect challenging yet realistic use cases for answer engines. For each query in each evaluation set, contractors were given two model responses and instructed to select the response that performed better for the following criteria:

* **Helpfulness**: which response answers the query and follow the specified instructions better?

* **Factuality**: which response provides more accurate answers without hallucinations, even for questions that require very precise or niche knowledge?

* **Freshness** (inspired by **[FreshLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03214)**): which response contains more up-to-date information? A model excels in this criterion if it is able to answer queries with “fresh” information.

In addition to the three criteria above, model responses were also evaluated holistically. To evaluate responses holistically, evaluators were asked to pick the response they would rather receive from an human assistant who is helping with the query.

[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) recently released two new PPLX models: pplx-7b-online and pplx-70b-online! Their online models are focused on delivering helpful, up-to-date, and factual responses, and are publicly available via** [**pplx-api](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs), making it a first-of-its-kind API. pplx-7b-online and pplx-70b-online are also accessible via [Perplexity Labs](https://labs.perplexity.ai/), their LLM playground.

LLMs have transformed the way we find information. However, there are two limitations with most LLMs today:

1. Freshness: LLMs often struggle to share up-to-date information.

2. Hallucinations: LLMs can also output inaccurate statements.

Their pplx-7b-online and pplx-70b-online models address current limitations by additionally providing helpful, factual, and up-to-date information in its responses.

**Update:** On January 4th 2024, Perplexity announced that it raised $73.6 million in a funding round led by IVP with additional investments from NEA, Databricks Ventures, former Twitter VP Elad Gil, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch. Other participants in the round included Nvidia and Jeff Bezos.

This valuation places the up and coming search engine at a roughly $520 million valuation. Considering that Perplexity’s only been around since August 2022, it’s a significantly impressive feat and signals a journey worth keeping an eye on.

[**Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

![Microsoft is scary litigious so I’m not showing screenshots past a login screen](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WPM4UlgwklDtr3N90jTKtw.png)

Copilot, formerly Bing Chat, owned by Microsoft, is a chat engine built into your browser to conversationally answer your questions for a variety of topics. Those topics include Laugh, Compare, Create, Organize, Write, Shop and Code. Conversation style can include the AI tone as more creative, more balanced, or more precise.

If you want to hear a joke, get career advice, write a poem, organize data, write step by step instructions, generate a shopping list or write some code, then the built in to browser Copilot is worth checking out.

The programs versatility leans into the research space and could be effectively utilized as such a tool.

What sets Leap AI apart is its API, which allows developers to integrate its capabilities into their own applications.

[Leap AI](https://tryleap.ai/?ref=blog.tryleap.ai) recently launched integration of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) foundation model, a sophisticated advancement in image generation. SDXL allows you to create intricate images with complex concepts in various art styles, including photorealism. The model is particularly good at generating difficult concepts such as hands, text, and spatially-arranged objects.

One of the key features of SDXL is its user-friendly prompting requirements. You can control the result using simpler prompts that keep the generation process true to your intentions. For example, a prompt like “a logo for my car company that looks like a lightning bolt” is enough for SDXL 1.0 to generate an accurate visual representation.

For developers, Leap AI makes it easy to implement SDXL with just a few lines of code, offering enhanced creative possibilities while handling the infrastructure. You can read more about generating images with Leap’s SDXL model [here](https://blog.tryleap.ai/generate-images-with-leaps-stable-diffusion-xl-api/).

### Niche AI Workflow Automation Applications

I first wrote this paragraph as a place filler, not entirely convinced this subcategory could stand alone. After all isn’t AI as a whole there to automate otherwise arduous, repetitive tasks. Oh boy was I wrong. Let’s explore workflow automation and some of the applications that are leveraging AI to grease the automation wheels.

[**Make**](https://www.make.com/en)

Listen, the fact of the matter is that I’m a sucker for any company that uses memes in their marketing efforts. As of today (Jan-18th-2024) Bardeen founders released [an article announcing Bardeen 2.0](https://www.bardeen.ai/posts/bardeen-2-0), they tout an impressive group of AI driven additions to their application.

This new toolbox of actions that let you bring AI to every workflow include message writing, classification, and even generating entire research reports.

**Browser Agent — **The Browser Agent works in real-time using your browser to complete any task you give it. An example being, ask the Browser Agent to describe the value proposition of a list of companies. To do that, it traverses the website, finds the information, and summarizes its reasoning — all you have to do is ask. These could be target accounts for your sales team, a recruitment candidate’s place of work, or even competitors you want to monitor.

**Categorizer** — Train an AI to categorize emails, leads, and even full-page documents. As an example, build a workflow to [flag interesting partnership opportunities in our inbox](https://www.bardeen.ai/playbooks/classify-and-save-desired-emails-to-google-sheets). You can also use this to qualify sales leads, categorize candidates based on experience, or even filter out those pesky cold outbound emails from your inbox.

**Message Generator** — A message is only as good as the information you use to write it. Bardeen is unique in the range and detail of information it can gather for you automatically — here, they directly [generate a sales email from the LinkedIn profile of a lead](https://www.bardeen.ai/playbooks/create-an-outreach-from-the-current-linkedin-profile). You can also use the Message Generator for LinkedIn messages, timely email follow-ups, or even text messages.

**Research Generator** — You don’t need to spend all day Googling and scouring multiple websites; use this instead. Their Research Generator uses AI to craft a report using information from sources like LinkedIn, company websites, and even Apollo.io. Here they [create a detailed company overview](https://www.bardeen.ai/playbooks/generate-a-company-research-report-in-a-google-doc-from-a-company-website-using-bardeenai) packed with details from LinkedIn, Alexa, and [Apollo.io](https://www.bardeen.ai/integrations/apollo-io) — all you need to provide is the target company’s website address.

With the recent additions via Bardeen 2.0 and their long history of success, Bardeen is a useful, accessible option in the world of automation that continues to show signs of growth in product & portfolio.

### Niche AI Chatbot Applications

Chatbots play a significant role in automating conversations, enhancing customer service, and streamlining various processes across different industries. Here are a couple lesser known entities as well as a short summary of maybe the biggest name in AI.

[**Chatbase**](https://www.chatbase.co/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3086/1*6TBh7Xw9lVjCfdiGIRECDQ.png)

Chatbots have been a part of industry customer service programs for decades. One of the major limitations for widespread adoption was the generic responses and prompting the maiden technology was capable of.

Chatbase is an AI chatbot building platform that enables users to create customized chatbots for their websites. It uses GPT-3.5 and GPT, understands the site (users submit a link to their website and the chatbot will scrape the text) and customer profile for naturally flowing. relevant conversation to prospects on your site 24–7.

The platform also allows users to upload a PDF document containing the information they would like their chatbot to be trained on. The current character limit is 1.2 million characters, which is equivalent to a 600–700 page book.

They state that more advanced integrations are available on request and simply require conversation with the big boss over there [Yasser Elsaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasserelsaid/?originalSubdomain=ca) (Founder). Next month is the companies first birthday, impressive progress made in such short time by the solo-founder.

If you need a chatbot and want it to be yours, understanding your company product and customer target persona, these are your guys.

[**Chatsimple**](https://www.chatsimple.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2778/1*xoKvTXomOgsR8JyOQORWAg.png)

Ok, hear me out, give me a chatbot but make it actually convert page visitors into scheduled prospect meetings.

Founded roughly 9 months ago by [Hao Sheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hao-sheng/?originalSubdomain=ca) this niche AI application has dialed in on leveraging AI to convert site visitors into qualified meetings.

They’ve recently announced a partnership with Calendly. Personally, I cant stand Calendly. When a salesperson sends me a link to click thru their calendar availability and schedule my own meeting I can’t help but feel a bit repulsed with how impersonal the whole thing is. Just coordinate with me and send a calendar invite?

Chatsimple’s approach falls far from this disdainful category. If I am searching for a solution, arrive on someone’s page and have a conversation with a bot that answers all my questions and piques my interest — automatically scheduling a call makes perfect sense and feels organic.

If you’re looking to increase conversion rate of qualified page visitors into scheduled meetings this is a fantastic option.

[**ChatGPT**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2638/1*1Rwf7oqFL3nrA9J1XDRpNQ.png)

ChatGPT, provided by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), has been the bee’s knees king of chat for a little over a year following their release of ChatGPT4. They first started making waves about a year after they were founded by [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman), when they released gpt3 in 2020. When that released public perception was pretty much, wow you’re a boss, but the boss of something that isn’t very useful.

In November of 2022 they drew attention again with the release of ChatGPT, following that they introduced 3.5 as a cost cutter. Coming full circle to modern day, they released ChatGPT4 and took the world by storm. There has been fierce competition rearing their head thru the chaos of leadership drama. The world looks on in anticipation to see if anyone may dethrone the king. Our lead engineers front runner is [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).

### Niche AI Video Applications

AI works with video in a lot of really fun ways. Some of them are convenient, some of them are novel, but all of them have a place in our society moving forward as we adjust to the machine spoon feeding us content. Let’s explore some of the ways AI is used for videos in non-traditional ways.

[**invideoAI]**(https://invideo.io/ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3006/1*LHSqFha0nElOzTBPRg-kmg.png)

Simple text to video generation is being done by a few entities, however, invideoAI brings a fresh twist on the concept by allowing intense filter options.

For instance, you have the ability to target specifically which platform your video is going to be posted on, (such as YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook), who your audience is (European travelers, NBA fans) as well as the style of video (professional, stylish, etc).

This application stands out to me as a short form content creators favorite tool. Create presentations, edit videos, generate scripts, video from text and generate voices all powered by inVideoAI’s proprietary AI. Founded by [Anshul Khandelwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshulk/), [Harsh Vakharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-vakharia-92a06443/), [Pankit Chheda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pankit-chheda-4a787529/), and [Sanket Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanketsh/) in 2017, with Anshul & Sanket still involved as CTO & CEO respectively, this is a group to keep an eye on.

[**Eightify**](https://eightify.app/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2194/1*TNKgBAWxWYbOhQTy0WZI5g.png)

Eightify is primarily a Google Chrome Extension that summarizes YouTube videos using its proprietary AI technology in conjunction with OpenAI GPT to extract, analyze, and condense the main points of a video. The extension is also available in Safari or as an iOS App.

Founded by [Alex Kataev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkatayev/) in May of 2022, Eightify has positioned itself well in its niche offering. The gist of their application being that you can extract key insights from YouTube videos without having to watch them.

Receive TLDR summaries, key point insights to the pivotal moments, a timestamp breakdown of key events/topics that includes a summary paragraph of each segment.

If you are someone who loves the informational aspect of video services like YouTube but recognize the time cost associated with viewing them, this is a fantastic tool to maintain the influx of information while cutting down on your wasted time.

TLDR: Eightify is cool

[**Klap**](https://klap.app/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3344/1*ucP8GWxNL1SRQW3hBuQqTQ.png)

Ever been scrolling youtube shorts or tiktok and think to yourself: Wow, there is no way someone really came to this video, watched the whole thing, cherry picked interesting moments throughout, edited them together and added colorful text captions to the speaker(s) voice. Most likely, you would be right!

Instead, creators are turning towards tools like Klap to take the manual efforts out of generating interesting, potentially viral content from longer form videos. It’s become a business model for some, crawling and ingesting certain creators long form videos, porting them into a system like Klap, and turning around and uploading them as shorts. Think clips of the Joe Rogan Experience, fitness influencer Sam Sulek, and similar long for content creators.

The price is reasonable starting at ~$30/month. Short form content is here to stay and utilizing AI to port an assembly line of videos out the door is sure to be around as long as attention spans stay short.

### Niche AI Prompt Applications

Sometimes the hardest part is just figuring out what to say. There are organizations focused on making the hard part easy by providing services centered around model accessibility and prompt catalogues.

[**Alicent**](https://alicent.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3004/1*1ILc2t43N9M8WWOyn6Ju9Q.png)

ChatGPT is an extremely powerful tool. Its release has thrust us into an era of prompt engineers who understand how to turn the funny digital dials and knobs ensuring the system gives relevant output to our objective.

Alicent AI is an all-in-one ChatGPT toolkit designed to assist professionals in content creation. One can only assume the name is based on Richard Wallace’s 1995 program, ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity). But back to the point.

Alicent leverages advanced AI for a variety of tasks though the service centers around their highly esteemed portfolio of prompts. This allows them to offer a variety of services such as transform podcast audio into written content, providing high-quality and relevant transcriptions. The application can summarize & prioritize feedback, and convert a website into an in-depth analysis of a business model. The tool is tailored for various professionals, including recruiters, tech writers, social media managers, and content creators.

They offer customizable presets, priority support, and designed the tool to seamlessly integrate with other platforms, aiming to streamline the content creation process.

[**PromptBox**](https://www.promptbox.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IwnEtT8lGCEXFXK5PsY5aw.png)

Unfortunately PromptBox website crashes my browser (to be fair the 70+ other open tabs are probably also to blame) so the below summary is sponsored by [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/summarize-promptbox-ai-NdBczQZRTUu0GKOBKpxNXw?s=u). It feels important to include them though as they seem to be unique compared to the other applications we’ve reviewed so far.

PromptBox is an innovative application that helps users organize, save, and share their AI prompts effectively. It is compatible with a wide range of AI tools and offers features such as drag-and-drop functionality, right-click-direct-save, and the ability to create reusable templates with variables. They recently announced the release of a new “folders” feature, allowing you to share folders of your commonly used prompts with others in a couple clicks.

The tool is gaining popularity within the AI community due to its user-friendly interface and versatile functionality. PromptBox is particularly beneficial for professionals working with AI tools, such as digital artists, copywriters, and productivity enthusiasts, looking to optimize their AI workflows and enhance their creative and productivity capabilities.

Ultimately, typing the same messages over and over is not just a waste of time but a source of frustration. PromptBox addresses this by being the go-to source for storing message templates.

### Niche AI Digital Advertising Applications

The introduction of digital advertising has forever altered how messages reach the masses. To successfully advertise online you typically need someone who has been in the online advertising space for years. These solutions aim to close the gap, optimizing the standard tracked metrics of an online campaign by leveraging the power of machine learning.

[**AdCopy**](https://adcopy.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gDjaAG3j1hX1ngTjaxRF9A.png)

Founded by [Anthony Mastellone ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonymastellone/)and Lucas Johnson in January 2023, AdCopy.ai is a powerful and user-friendly AI-driven tool designed to cater to digital advertisers who aim to improve their ad performance and increase clicks and conversions. The tool possesses the latest AI capabilities and customizable features that allow users to generate high-quality, compliance-driven ad copies that deliver positive outcomes.

They appear to be a data driven company, with primary selling points across their webpage to improve the fundamental marketing metrics that define successful campaigns.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jCFkFxzIJUUMCB4Ih13DDg.png)

[**AdCreative.ai**](https://www.adcreative.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3226/1*tVRDdgm4PbYYSI42L2KSvQ.png)

AdCreative.ai is a data company that possesses one of the largest databases of high-conversion-rate ad creatives. They claim to be the only company capable of generating conversion-focused ad creatives using generative AI.

In a simple gist, everything about AdCreative is to leverage AI to create more effective ads in a fraction of the time compared to a human. This includes generating an entire ad package, videos from your assets and product photo shoots.

Where they stand out (beyond offering such a wide breadth of service) is the platforms insight into competitor performance. They target startups, eCommerce, digital ad agencies and enterprise customers.

A Paris based company, AdCreative was founded in late 2021 by [Tufan Gok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tufan-gok/) (CEO), [Tarik Ince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/incetarik/?originalSubdomain=tr), and [Yusuf Kaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ysfky/?locale=en_US) (Chief Creative Officer).

[**Pencil**](https://www.trypencil.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2976/1*clXagiTQrEHdytCUmDd-iQ.png)

Marketing is forever the guessing game of, “Do I understand my target audience”. Ultimately, the difficulty of predicting success for campaigns is left to the experience of whatever mega-mind is designing campaign initiatives to generate content.

Pencil has a variety of services centered around digital video advertising. They offer unique marketing insights with predictive modeling and video generation based on your uploaded assets. As far as I understand, this is similar to what Google Ads offers for automated video generation to be served to an audience on YouTube (but better).

In my opinion what makes them special is their $1B ad spend performance metrics dataset. Testing campaigns is a budget killer, being able to leverage AI to understand historical performance for your profile of ad content should in theory reduce wasted ad spend, improving ROI. Optimizing up front instead of 7 days down the line is intuitively beneficial.

Being at an organization that runs Google ads for a learn to code platform, I’d like to better understand the industry/market breakdown of their billion-dollar ad spend dataset to see if its recommendations would be directly applicable to my line of business. Though after all, isn’t one of the neat things about AI that it can extrapolate general trends from specific data points? Maybe their dataset doesn’t need to have my industry specifics to propose meaningful changes to my campaign.

### Niche AI General Marketing Applications

Artificial Intelligence has brought meaningful change to the forefront of many different industries. A lot of the different niche offers we cover in this article could fit into general marketing, but most were able to fit into other unique subcategories.

[**BlogSEO AI**](https://www.blogseo.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2676/1*QnXpJ4Mg0p7F9jLgt6nlsA.png)

Say goodbye to writer’s block and analysis paralysis. Meet BlogSEO, the AI writer that helps you research, analyze, and generate high-quality, SEO-ready blog articles based on your website.

As someone currently writing a long form piece of content, this was very interesting to run across. Can’t help but wonder if the offer meets expectations as far as quality of content. Either way, if you are heavily relying on ChatGPT etc for article generation this looks like an excellent alternative that prioritizes your desired keywords during generation.

The offer goes above and beyond simple text generation, with clear insights into your website performance via their analytic dashboard as well as direct connection to common blogging sites — allowing for seamless transition from article generation to post.

Cherry on top? They support 19 languages. Ever tried keyword research in another language? Me either, sounds like a nightmare.

[**Copyai**](https://www.copy.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3126/1*PSyGvGIixzFustZfSjVz9w.png)

Copy.ai is an AI-powered writing tool that generates text for users based on their input. It uses machine learning algorithms to understand the context of the input and generate high-quality, human-like content in a matter of seconds.

[**Jasper**](https://www.jasper.ai)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2330/1*iqAcliyZg-qo7G2Nm_9fPA.png)

Launched in February 2021, Jasper is an AI content platform that helps creators and companies of all types expand their creative potential.

[In a 2023 study](https://www.jasper.ai/the-prompt/ai-business-trend-report), Jasper found the leading reasons marketers are hesitant to try AI are generic outputs (35%) and inaccuracies (36%). Their knowledge hub meets this skepticism head on by absorbing all of your current marketing content and company values to generate written suggestions that are relevant to your company.

The application of understanding your business’s brand and how it fits into the industry in comparison to your competition leads Jasper to deliver unique, creative, accurate and effective content across a broad spectrum of distribution pipelines.

[**Writesonic**](https://writesonic.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2780/1*KP7oUnCMHtyH7rWKdW6vUA.png)

Founded by [Samanyou Garg ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanyougarg/?originalSubdomain=in)in mid-2021, Writesonic is a leading generative AI Platform for Content Creation, SEO, and AI Chatbots. Improving the lives of over 10 million users by helping brands produce personalized, fact-checked, and SEO-optimized content at scale.

From the marketing writer’s perspective, the ability to have a tool create content with SEO in mind is a huge plus.

### Niche AI Website Applications

Building websites can be extremely boring and tedious. It’s pretty much universally agreed that front end work finishes last place in the coding fun race. On top of that, the common man with a business idea has a steep technical curve to overcome when it comes to publicly presenting themselves as an operating business.

Luckily, with the uptick in AI application, there’s a multitude of organizations that offer website generation services, lets dive into them!

[**10Web**](https://10web.io/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2514/1*ih_guH6sc70f_iwCxHQ2og.png)

Co-founded by [Arto Minasyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artominasyan/) and [Tigran Nazaryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tnazaryan/) in 2017, 10Web elevates businesses by leveraging AI in a multitude of ways. Primarily, their function is to bring websites from idea to reality in a fraction of the time compared to traditional building processes.

Nobody says it better than 10Web’s vision statement itself:

“We imagine a world where website hosting, building, and maintenance are so simplified that everyone can publish a beautiful and fully functional website in a couple of minutes. The continuous process of automating website development is enabling this great vision.”

All in all, if you’re looking for expedited website creation, check these guys out!

[**Styleai**](https://usestyle.ai/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2206/1*3E9NJWg9RUtlrm1jPrRjbw.png)

Positioning themselves as your personal digital marketing agency, StyleAI got kicked off in 2020 by a group of folks out of the Bay area.

Style is an AI web solution that revolutionizes the way businesses create their online presence. They utilize cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to help their customers create, promote, and advertise stunning and engaging websites in just minutes.

Their Seona offering is an AI SEO tool that automatically boosts your online discoverability to reach more customers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2114/1*Qh6hoHnhjPx0cK6zOT-5Rw.png)

Interestingly, Astra, their google AdWords AI manager, will spin up campaigns based on your requirements, automatically adjusting them as the online landscape shifts. Astra analyzes your website, gaining valuable insights about your business to craft optimal ads.

As someone who recently has been exploring partnership with paid ad management, these guys stand out as worth a try if the price is right. Compared to the average cost of partnering with an agency, at a reasonable $10/day starting point, Astra is certainly worth exploring if you’re tired of playing the constant keyword update game.

[**Durable**](http://durable.co)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2338/1*fw0nOlOStvX70s-ApUVsfg.png)

Founded by [James Clift](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jclift/?originalSubdomain=ca) (CEO) in late 2021, Durable’s primary objective is to make owning a business easier than having a job. A lot of people have an internal desire to take ownership or “be their own boss”, speculating greater life satisfaction by providing a service they’re passionate about that improves people’s lives.

Typically, the biggest road block to starting your own company tend to be financial. So instead of paying somebody to build their companies fundamentals, such as a website, folks will self-teach in hope of saving the contractor fees.

As an alternative, Durable closes the founder skill gap by deploying a website for you, allowing you to specialize & focus on other elements of your business creation.

Interestingly, as I navigate the Durable site and James Clift’s online presence, there seems to be a genuine desire and paved road for taking a business from concept to creation as seamlessly as possible.

From guided templates for startup fundamentals, state specific business creation guidelines and overall best practice resources, to built in CRM, accounting (invoicing) tools, and automated blog building. AI in business is making waves and James is doing a fantastic job of bringing it to the starting line for first time self-employers.

This has been one of my favorites on the list so far and I wholly endorse a discovery of James’ creation.

### **Niche AI Code Learning Applications**

Learning to code — like learning to do most things, is a journey filled with plateaus and breakthroughs. The big question people get hung up on:
>  *“where do I start?”*

The first step is to grasp the fundamentals, there is arguably no better way to do so than by picking a small problem or project that you’re interested in undertaking. When you’ve got something close to the heart that you care about, it can be a great motivator to persevere through the lulls of the learning process.

Once you’ve got a project in mind, do some research to see what languages are compatible with your desired task. From there, the combination of a guided beginner focused resource and google will be your best friends. Having access to all this information is undoubtedly a net benefit, but we find ourselves back at the original dilemma: how am I supposed to make sense of the practically infinite number of answers online, what’s correct, what’s going to be a waste of time and what is just fundamentally wrong.

**A wall for your ball**

This is where the benefit of an experienced developer comes into play, you can flock to reddit and post questions in various online communities hoping someone will give you an answer. Most of the time someone will eventually respond, but there’s a delay and the answer may either be inaccurate or require an expanded explanation itself.

Learning to code in the age of AI resolves this issue, instead of a random experienced dev sporadically half-answering your questions — why not ask an AI model? There are resources, such as [GIGO’s](http://gigo.dev) CodeTeacher, that are available online to do exactly that. The ability to bounce ideas, ask questions and have them bounce right back is critical for aspiring programmers to keep momentum, ultimately accelerating the learning process.

## GIGO Dev

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3326/1*XGjBT1vD_Bw1LuwGrC24IA.png)

[gigo.dev](http://gigo.dev) streamlines the developer learning process.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3338/1*Pl1mcG905uRPlxdViBGa1A.png)

Built by self taught developers, GIGO focuses on aligning learning with the real world of development. The team that built GIGO has each individually felt the pain of trying to learn programming alone from online resources, as a group they fostered a fundamental requirement for the platform:

## “Instead of learning to code, you must learn to be a developer.“

Many online resources are capable of teaching the basics of syntax and simple concepts such as functions and loops. Where most fall short (and hinder self learners from landing real world programming jobs) is they don’t teach how to be a functioning member of a development team.

Concepts such as pushing new builds to production, proper testing, debugging (information gathering) and appropriate code structuring are often completely absent from online pre-packaged learning resources.

[GIGO](http://gigo.dev) offers a catalogue of ready to go projects delivered in an easily digestible format.

![Project cards for user selection](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3348/1*7hO-odM22VysJWLzpMPJPw.png)

Those just starting out their coding journey are presented with a simplified, but engaging experience.

![DevSpace launch page — 2048 included](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3328/1*YQAeFPm8H6gTiOJOGAqyog.png)

One of the most challenging aspects of beginning to program is downloading and configuring an IDE (integrated development environment) with the appropriate language and file structure. [GIGO](http://gigo.dev) removes this challenge by offering a built in pre-configured IDE.

![Built in pre-configured](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3346/1*n4cnU4Gz0NBdU5eJfmDnjg.png)

This is actually VScode, a commonly used IDE in the world of development. By introducing beginners to VScode, this not only allows beginners to execute code on a whim with no set up, but also familiarize themselves with one of the commonly used tools by developers in the workforce.

![CodeTeacher — the in IDE guide to becoming a developer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2328/1*H4ImKAJygzVQu4BSQ21SnQ.png)

A massive advantage of the GIGO platform is the AI backed CodeTeacher. Code Teacher (CT for short) is an advanced educational chatbot designed to help developers at all levels. Whether you are learning to code, fixing existing code, or writing new code, Code Teacher is there to help.

CT apart has intimate knowledge of your entire code base and can see what you see in the editor, offering precise and relevant guidance.

Additionally, CT can help you navigate the GIGO platform and assist you in crafting workspace configurations for your GIGO DevSpaces, making your coding experience seamless and integrated.

If you are starting your coding journey and wish to accelerate the learning process with a vibrant community of like-minded learners, and live-time feedback on your project attempts, then [GIGO](http://gigo.dev) may be right for you.

Here is a link to the project Python Basics: From Hello World to Classes [https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1688617436791701504](https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1688617436791701504)
