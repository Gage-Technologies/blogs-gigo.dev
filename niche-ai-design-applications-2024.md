Professional photographers don’t get enough credit for just how difficult capturing the perfect shot is. Most will tell you the magic happens when its time to edit the moments they’ve encapsulated through lens.

Whether it be consumer packaged goods, people, food or large objects, there is an inherit need to automate the monotonous tasks required to bring a picture from moment captured to professionally presentable material. Let’s explore some of the unique AI applications that do exactly that, among other design oriented tasks.

[**Flair.ai**](https://flair.ai/)

Flair ai addresses a very unique sector of product advertising. Most of us have probably seen a behind the scenes video of [how food advertisements are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=d7iSFl5cp84). Ever wonder how food commercials look so mouthwatering and perfect? A huge portion of this is the stage the photographers set.

In the world of packaged goods and consumer products, teams of artistic individuals work to ensure the “stage” is set for their product. Flair reduces cost and time to set the stage by leveraging AI to mix & match product placement across a variety of templates.

Drag and drop images, props, and 3D assets. Adjust the lighting and camera angle to compose the perfect scene. This AI application **accelerates an organization’s ability to test design concepts**.

Founded in late 2022 by Mickey Friedman and Antonio Cao, if you are looking to generate high-end product photography in minutes for CPG and Beauty Brands, check out this AI design tool for branded content.

[**Designify**](https://www.designify.com/)

Designify is Artificial Intelligence for design. They claim to combine the world’s most advanced visual AIs into one simple tool. Users have the ability to remove backgrounds from any image in high quality, add realistic shadows and enhance colors to create beautiful designs.

Designify, a division of Kaleido AI, which was acquired by Canva in 2021 for what has been theorized as close to $100M, is re-imagining AI powered design tools. Kaleido was founded in 2017 by Benjamin Groessing (CEO) and David Fankhauser (CTO), both of whom still carry their Kaleido responsibilities as well as roles in their acquirer Canva.

Honestly the service looks pretty cool. **Users can upload generic images of a product (such as a watch in its case) and replace the background with a professional presenting aesthetic**. The same can be accomplished with images of people or larger objects such as motor vehicles. From there, their in-suite editor allows for customization such as adding logos, shadow adjustments and more.

[**ClipDrop**](https://clipdrop.co/)

ClipDrop is a Paris based company founded in 2020 by Cyril Diagne (CEO), Jonathan Blanchet (former CTO) and Damien Henry (COO). Better known as Init ML (ClipDrop parent company), they were acquired by Stability AI in 2023. They offer a variety of design-based services that turn mobile photos into professional product visuals.

Thanks to companies like Poshmark, Etsy and eBay, there are now over 30M sellers who need great visuals for their shops but most of them don’t have access to a professional photographer or a design team.

**ClipDrop Differentation**
ClipDrop reduces friction in the design process with a multitude of AI based tools at their client’s disposal. Among other things, you can swap model faces, replace or remove backgrounds and leverage Stable Diffusion for a variety of tasks.

What stands out to me is their ability to upscale image quality. Having the ability to take an image and manipulate the tone, lighting and reduce fuzzy pixels means photographers can get more out of each picture.

There is an [excellent article](https://clipdrop.co/blog/relight-photo-studio) on their blog that highlights some of the unique things this AI backed solution can accomplish with ease.

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/)

If you’ve ever found yourself googling, “free AI image generator” then you’re likely to have come across Canva (kudos — Canva marketing team).

Canva is not primarily a free image generator; it is however a versatile graphic design platform that allows users to create a wide range of visual content. They provide a user-friendly interface with various tools and templates for designing graphics, presentations, social media posts, and more.

Users can access a vast library of images, illustrations, and design elements to customize their creations. Canva is popular for its simplicity and accessibility, making it suitable for both beginners and professionals in need of quick and visually appealing design solutions.

Founded in 2012 by Melanie Perkins (CEO), Cliff Obrecht (COO) and Cameron Adams (Chief Product Officer), the story of the founders is one of the more interesting I’ve had the opportunity to research.

For the hopeless romantics in the tech world, Melanie & Cliff got married almost a decade after launch. Looking for love? Start a company with your ideal partner and raise the valuation to $20B+ over a decade of hard work, easy peasy, problem solved.

**In Conclusion**

The future of design lies at the intersection of human ingenuity and machine learning, where the impossible becomes possible and the unimaginable comes to life.

As we embrace this exciting collaboration between technology and the human touch will shape a world where every pixel, curve, and color tells a story of innovation and endless possibilities. Cheers to the companies pushing the boundaries of innovation, unlocking new possibilities in the world of visual communication.
