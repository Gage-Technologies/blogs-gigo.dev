# What are Journeys in GIGO?

GIGO Dev is an AI-powered educational platform that aims to help aspiring developers learn coding concepts and build practical skills for software engineering.

The platform provides a large repository of [Bytes](https://medium.com/@gigo_dev/what-are-bytes-in-gigo-8a9a58ae744f), which are short, targeted coding challenges to help developers improve their programming skills through hands-on practice.

Let’s discuss what Journeys are in GIGO Dev, how they correlate to Bytes and greatly benefit your coding journey.

**What are Journeys in GIGO Dev?**

Journeys in GIGO Dev are a series of Bytes ordered to guide users through programming concepts in a fun, meaningful way.

Each Journey is designed to cover a specific topic, such as data structures, web development, game development or basic language syntax.

The Journey consists of a series of Bytes that build upon each other to help users understand the concept in a practical, hands-on way.

**Why are GIGO Dev Journeys Important?**

Journeys are an essential part of the learning process for aspiring developers. They provide an opportunity to learn programming concepts in a structured and interactive way.

By completing a Journey, developers can gain a deep understanding of a specific topic and build practical skills that can be applied to real-world coding challenges. Journeys allow developers to track their progress and identify areas where they need to improve.

**How do Journeys in GIGO Dev Work?**

Journeys in GIGO Dev are designed to be easy to use and accessible to individuals of all skill levels. Each Journey comes with a set of instructions, resources, and an AI code tutor, called Code Teacher, to help shepherd learners past the sticking points

Once you have selected a Journey, you can start working on the first Byte within GIGO’s pre-configured IDE. The IDE comes with all necessary tools and resources to complete the Byte, including a code editor, debugger, and terminal.

In addition to debugging and general chat interface, Code Teacher provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help you improve your code and solve the problem more efficiently, helping you to write code in a way most developers will be able to understand in a professional setting.

**In Summary**

Journeys are an essential part of the learning process for aspiring developers. GIGO Dev provides a large repository of Journeys to help individuals build practical skills and track their progress.

With pre-configured IDEs and interactive, structured learning, GIGO Dev is the superior place to learn to code.

Whether you are just starting your coding journey or looking to build your skills, GIGO Dev has a Journey that aligns with your interests and skill level.
