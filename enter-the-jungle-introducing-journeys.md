# Enter the Jungle: Introducing Journeys

A path appears before them. Hearts racing and set on success, they start creeping down the overgrown trail plunging into the unknown, contemplating the seriousness of their quest. With determination, “I want to learn to code” echoes through an opening in the trees.

The first steps down a new road don't have to be scary. But without the proper planning, consistency and execution can become monsters in their own right. 

GIGO Dev provides structure for new and experienced programmers to improve their programming skills.

Pre-configured IDE’s encourage new users to try things that would take them hours or days to set up, instead they are programming in minutes. This accessibility lets learners try, fail and succeed to obtain experience more quickly.

Combine this accessibility with structured learning and GIGO Dev’s AI powered platform accelerates the learning process bringing beginner coders up to speed more quickly than any other learn to code offer available online.

Let’s step off the beaten path and learn how Journeys can help you reach your coding goals.

**What is a GIGO Dev Journey?**

Journeys are the duolingo for code. A collection of Bytes are ordered giving a stepping stone approach to help you reach your desired topical understanding, these are called units.

What if you want to do something cool in Python and need to get started on the absolute basics? The first concept to conquer in your Journey is the Hello Python language basics unit.

The gold mark represents a completed Byte. By completing the full Byte collection, you’ll get an understanding of the basics of Python. Lets select the second step in our Journey and see where that takes us…

We find ourselves in the [Printing Variables Byte](https://www.gigo.dev/byte/1769721240139857920) where we’ll learn how to declare a variable and print its value. Here is where things get interesting.

**Code Teacher Journey integration**

Code Teacher is a personal tutor system integrated directly into Bytes and is designed to help you learn to code as fast as possible.

This is accomplished by deeply integrating with your code editor and Byte. Code Teacher can see your code as you write it to help you better understand your objectives and solve problems.

Code Teacher is your personal tutor. It is here to help you at all times. You can ask Code Teacher simple questions like “What’s a boolean?” or more complex questions like “What is left to do to complete this Byte?”

Code Teacher is an AI powered tool built into every Project, Byte and Journey on GIGO Dev. Being able to rely on a knowledge source akin to an experienced developer that sees and understands your code will help you learn faster and stay engaged.

This process also builds familiarity interacting with AI tools in a coding task oriented setting which will translate to the day-to-day activities in your role as a professional developer.

**Learning to code with Journeys**

With the help of Code Teacher I was able to complete the Print Variables Byte and move on to the next step in my Hello Python unit. Let’s take a look at the bigger picture.

Your Journey is a collection of Bytes called Units that are tailored towards grasping the building blocks of the overarching concept you want to learn. Once we complete the Hello Python unit, we continue into the next section of our Journey.

After each completed section, the GIGO Dev platform assesses where you’re at in your current journey and offers recommended units to add to your Journey map.

However, as you complete Bytes and expand your knowledge-base its natural for the topics you’re interested in to expand. You should have the ability to personally add new concepts to your Journey on demand.

We call these Detours, Detours are your ability to add interesting units to your Journey. Here’s what it looks like when assessing detour options.

**GIGO Dev is the best place to learn to code**

Journeys are designed to take users from zero to full understanding of programming concepts as quickly as possible. They offer structure for new and experienced programmers to improve their programming skills.

Learning to code can be overwhelming, without a proper guideline you might end up suffering from inconsistency and lack of motivation. Ensure you’re spending your valuable time in the best way. Enter the Jungle and start your Journey today at [gigo.dev](gigo.dev)
