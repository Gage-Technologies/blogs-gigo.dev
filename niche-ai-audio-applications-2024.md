In our world people use tools to assist in completion of their objective. We use hammers instead of fists, but the hammer simply cannot replace the human element. AI does not always follow this formula.

Sometimes AI is used as a tool to assist humans while other times the final product replaces the need for a person altogether. Here we take a look at how niche AI Audio applications support both of these paths.

[**Lovo**](https://lovo.ai/)

Lovo is an award-winning AI Voice Generator and text to speech software with 500+ voices in 100 languages. The organization offers a variety of AI based services including art generation, script generation, text-to-speech, voice cloning and general voice generation. But where they really shine as a unique offer in my opinion is their hyper realistic voice generation.

This AI-powered solution eliminates the need for expensive voice talent, as it can generate realistic voices in a fraction of the time and cost. It features a library of 500+ voices with various styles, granular voice control, sound effects and music, and voices capable of expressing up to 25+ emotions.

With LOVO, users can create explainer videos, podcasts, social media content, and e-learning materials with ease. It also comes with an intuitive, yet full-featured UI that makes it easy for users to access all of its features.

Founded in January of 2019 by Tom Lee (COO) and Charlie Choi (CEO/Wizard), the company has had an impressive series of raises positioning themselves as the go to voice and synthetic speech tool of the future.

Whether a content creator or an enterprise looking to update training material, these guys stand out as a competent team with a competitive product.

[**ElevenLabs**](https://elevenlabs.io/)

Founded in 2022 by “best friends” Piotr Dabkowski and Mati Staniszewski, ElevenLabs came out swinging with a successful demo and release.

Their mission is to make audio content universally accessible in any language. To accomplish this, they’ve researched new methods for voice generation that preserve the distinctive features of speech — like emotions, intonation and intent — across languages.

Inspired by the ‘poor’ dubbing of Hollywood movies they watched growing up in their native Poland, the pair set about designing a platform which could eliminate the linguistic barriers of content.

Enter “Speech to Speech” technology. Here is where they shine on making their childhood dreams come true. The recently released AI dubbing tool gives users the ability to automatically re-voice any audio or video in a different language, all while preserving the original speaker’s voice.

Their research powers the platform’s current features but it also contributes to realizing their ultimate goal of **instantly converting spoken audio between languages**. How cool is that?

[**Songburst**](https://www.songburst.ai/)

Ever needed a catchy tune to accompany a video for one of your projects? Songburst is an AI music generator built for iOS that **allows users to generate unique musical tracks via prompting**.

The app, developed by Brett Bauman, uses generative AI to create music based on user provided input. You can export the generated songs to use in your online content or listen to them on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.

The app is available for free with the option to purchase a subscription for additional features, such as 20 song credits per month and the ability to download tracks in mp3 format. The generated music clips are currently limited to 30 seconds, and the app is designed to provide a simple and mobile-native text-to-music solution.

If you’re tired of surfing catalogues of free samples to find just the right unique fit for your promotion, Songburst is your new go-to service.
