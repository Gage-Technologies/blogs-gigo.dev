# Learn to code - GIGO Bytes

It’s important to build a strong foundation when learning programming. Thinking about things in terms of architecture, organization, and survival skills is extremely beneficial.

Finding a course (or even simply reading wikipedia) on computer structure will enlighten you to many of the early decisions made for programming languages. This fundamental understanding is the first step to your application of logic in computer programming.

What differentiates a novice from a veteran programmer is how they organize their code. Once you familiarize yourself with this structure, reading and understanding code becomes much more simple. To become part of the club, you must understand their written and unwritten rules.

Survival skills can be alternatively defined as research skills. Easily the most important skill a programmer can have is mastering Google to find their answer. Understanding your problem to the best of your ability and using forums like StackOverflow are extremely helpful for diagnosing and assessing problems.

**What are GIGO Bytes?**

GIGO Dev is an education technology platform that helps aspiring developers learn coding concepts and build practical technology skills while familiarizing themselves with modern programming tools.

The platform was created by a group of self-taught developers and provides a large repository of Bytes, which are short, targeted coding challenges hosted on the GIGO Dev platform to help developers improve their programming skills through hands-on practice.

The IDE comes with all the necessary tools and resources to complete the challenge, including a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Additionally, the IDE provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help you improve your code and solve the problem more efficiently.

These benefits are available due to Code Teacher’s deep integration with the platform, understanding the code you’re working on gives the system unique insight to increase performance and make recommendations.

**Code Teacher in GIGO Dev**

[Code Teacher](https://medium.com/@gigo_dev/what-is-gigo-devs-code-teacher-a-peek-into-the-online-learning-revolution-a5564088c833) is the pillar of GIGO’s learn to code platform. Serving as a private tutor capable of conversational guidance throughout the learning process, Code Teacher gives suggestions for next steps, Debugging support, and Code Clean Up to help prospective coders learn real life development skills.

Code Teacher acts as a personal programming tutor, improving your ability to absorb and retain important information while learning to code like a developer.

This early stage introduction to AI tools builds familiarity in prospective coders leading to higher levels of confidence when put into situations where they don’t know whats going on.

**In Summary**

Bytes are uniquely paired with Code Teacher, our AI-powered tutor, to create a personal and immersive learning experience. This integration is designed with the beginner in mind, transforming the daunting task of learning to program into an engaging and supportive journey.

By pairing Bytes’ quick programming challenges with the intelligent guidance of Code Teacher, learners are not just exposed to new concepts but are walked through them, ensuring a deep and practical understanding of programming foundations.
