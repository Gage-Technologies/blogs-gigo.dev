Technology is changing the way we live. At the time of publishing over 92% of all jobs require digital skills. This digital transformation has led to an appropriate increased demand for software developers.

In this article, we’ll discuss how you can achieve higher paying jobs and better benefits by learning to code from scratch.

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for computers or machines. We call these instructions code. Code enables computers to perform specific tasks, solve problems, or create desired outputs.

You may have heard terms like Python and JavaScript before. These are different languages of code. Like human languages, such as English and Portuguese, there are unique rules and guidelines that all Programming languages follow.

These rules, known as syntax, are used to write the code, allowing programmers to uniformly communicate with the computer effectively across a broad spectrum of applications.

## Why Learn Programming?

Software developers are in-demand and highly compensated. Computer programming is a hard skill, once you’ve obtained the information you’ll have access to a wide range of good paying roles offered by employers who need somebody with your knowledge base.

Beyond professional opportunity, knowing how to program is essentially a super power. Think of it as having the ability to bring your ideas to life. The only thing limiting your creations are your imagination and willingness to commit time.

The greatest benefit, though perhaps more subtle, is a new critical thinking blueprint. When you learn to program, you learn to design solutions to your specific problems. Crafting genuinely creative internal assessment systems for more impactful, efficient problem solving.

## Steps to landing your first programming job in 2024

1. Pick a Project
2. Build Programming Fundamentals
3. Learn Programming Basics
4. Work on Projects
5. Apply for a Job

### 1. Pick a Project

The best way to learn to code is to learn by doing. This comes down to identifying something that you want to build and working towards it on a daily basis, incrementally stepping to the final version gaining proficiency at each step along the way.

Pick something you care about that will keep you motivated. This is a far superior method to just stepping thru the language specific “books”, also known as language documentation. Instead of reciting an encyclopedia of syntax definitions, you understand concepts in the context that they are applicable to helping accomplish a task.

When it comes time to search for a job, you may have no previous programming employment history, but you can point towards a repository of projects you’ve either completed or contributed to.

### **2. Build Programming Fundamentals**

Most programmers worth their salt know multiple languages. There are common principles that every language uses and while sometimes they are called different names, the fundamentals remain the same. Learning the fundamentals will help you immensely as you move onto your project.

As an example, here are some programming fundamentals beginners need to know to start coding:

Syntax — The rules that define the structure of the language. The syntax tells you exactly which words and symbols you need to use when you write your code based on its language. Because computers don’t think, you have to be very specific when writing code. At some point, every programmer has sat at the keyboard trying to figure out why their code wasn’t working only to realize they were missing something simple, like a semicolon. (i.e a simple syntax error)

Tools — There are a variety of tools that make programming easier. For example, one of the core programming tools is an integrated development environment (IDE), that checks your syntax for errors, organizes your files, and autocompletes lines of code for you. Another fantastic example of a modern tool that programmers use is generative AI such as ChatGPT, Mistral or MetaAI.

Learning to take advantage of these tools and using them to their full potential will reduce the impact of the inevitable bumps in your coding journey.

### **3. Learn Programming Basics**

If you have a specific reason for learning to code, you may already know which language you want to start with. For instance, if you want to be a game developer, C++ & JavaScript are probably your best choice. If you want to learn to program but haven’t determined your first language, there are several beginner-friendly languages that serve as a good starting point. Python is one of the easiest languages for beginners to pick up.

### **4. Work on Projects**

From here it all becomes a numbers game, how many projects can you get under your belt.

How To Choose Programming Projects

**Start Simple**

It’s best to start with simple projects. If you want to get into game design, you may be tempted to start trying to create the next massive online role-playing game. However, you’ll be better off creating something simple, such as a basic top down shooter with one level.

A static portfolio website is a simple option that can grow with you. You can show off what you know and add more complicated projects as you master more skills.

**Create Something Useful**

Think about the “sticking points” of your day. Do you run into the same problems or regularly have to do the same repetitive activities? Create something that will solve the problem or automate the work for you. Your community is great for ideas, too. Do the people in your clubs or organizations complain about the same issues often? See if you can brainstorm a solution. Real-world problem solving is a great addition to your portfolio.

### **5. Apply for a Job**

It all comes down to this. You’ve grasped the fundamentals, you’ve built out a handful of projects — some you’re passionate about and some you’re indifferent to. Its time to start the application process.

Find jobs that fit your experience, particularly that match the languages you’ve been working in. Remote jobs are extremely competitive right now, your best bet is to find an entry level in person role with a modest salary offer.

Keep putting experience under your belt and with consistent performance you’ll naturally grow your skill to a level that's compatible with higher paying, remote roles.

**Find a platform to guide you**

Take all of these concepts prior to job application and put them together. Where can I find a program that will guide me step by step thru programming fundamentals and project completion?
