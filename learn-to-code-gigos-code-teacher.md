# Learn to code - GIGO's Code Teacher 

GIGO Dev provides structured learning for new and experienced programmers to improve their programming skills.

Pre-configured IDE’s encourage new users to try things that would take them hours or days to set up, instead they are programming in minutes. This accessibility lets learners try, fail and succeed to obtain experience more quickly.

Combine this accessibility with structured learning and GIGO Dev’s AI powered platform accelerates the learning process bringing coders up to speed more quickly than any other learn to code offer available online.

**Learning to code**

It’s important to build a strong foundation when learning programming. Thinking about things in terms of architecture, organization, and survival skills is extremely beneficial.

Finding a course (or even simply reading wikipedia) on computer structure will enlighten you to many of the early decisions made for programming languages. This fundamental understanding is the first step to your application of logic in computer programming.

What differentiates a novice from a veteran programmer is how they organize their code. Once you familiarize yourself with this structure, reading and understanding code becomes much more simple. To become part of the club, you must understand their written and unwritten rules.

Survival skills can be alternatively defined as research skills. Easily the most important skill a programmer can have is mastering Google to find their answer. This instills a sense of self-sufficiency, an extremely desirable trait for programmers to have.

All these aspects were considered in the development of GIGO Journeys. The platform is designed to teach common sense programmer fundamentals as well as proper code structure & research skills by setting an inquisitive environment with access to a knowledge base via text interface with Code Teacher.

**What is Code Teacher?**

Whether you are specializing in a subject for a targeted role or seeking front-end, back-end or full stack experience, Code Teacher is custom built to help you achieve your subject matter expertise in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education and other online course based material.

Built by self-taught devs — for self taught devs. Code Teacher is the brain child of a team of programmers who wish they had more support during the early days of their learning journey.

Code Teacher acts as a personal programming tutor, improving your ability to absorb and retain important information while learning to code like a developer.

**Cleanup, debugging and Next step suggestions**

Code Teacher promotes best practices for developers wanting to write clean, production-caliber code.

1. What To Do Next: Many new developers get stuck and struggle with next steps after completing a segment of their project — CodeTeacher is here to help. With an intimate knowledge of your progress, completed challenges and written code, answers can be given before questions are asked. A dynamic, reliable guiding hand when StackOverflow and Google doesn’t return the answers you’re looking for.

2. Debug: Every step of development is riddled with roadblocks. CT is integrated at every junction, helpfully nudging users in the right direction. When an error occurs, CodeTeacher is there to highlight issues in the code with thought-provoking insight to the bug.

3. Code Clean Up: A lot of developers know how to make their code work, but don’t know how to make their code readable. To build real-world applicable skills, CodeTeacher teaches the developer how to write code that others can read. This is achieved by showing examples of a more efficient version of their code, teaching them proper coding procedures.

### Code Teacher in GIGO Dev

Code Teacher is the pillar of GIGO’s learn to code platform. Serving as a private tutor capable of conversational guidance throughout the learning process, Code Teacher gives suggestions for next steps, Debugging support, and Code Clean Up to help prospective coders learn real life development skills.

Instead of committing years of your time and tens of thousands of dollars to formal education, or months and hundreds of dollars to other online learn to code platforms, choose GIGO Dev to accelerate your learning process at an affordable rate — allowing you to achieve your goals in less time for a better price.
