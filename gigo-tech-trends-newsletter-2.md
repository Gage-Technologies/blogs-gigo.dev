A synopsis of cloud computing

Cloud computing provides a flexible and scalable way to access computing resources over the internet. By shifting away from in-house infrastructure to cloud-based solutions, both businesses and individuals can tap into numerous opportunities. Although there are some drawbacks to cloud computing, there’s no denying its market is expanding rapidly.

**What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more — over the Internet. It eliminates the need for in-house infrastructure and servers and can grant access on an as-needed basis.

**Types of Cloud Computing**

* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): This allows users to access computational resources over the internet, allowing them to rent IT hardware.

* Platform as a Service (PaaS): This provides a platform allowing customers to access both hardware and software to develop, run, and manage applications.

* Software as a Service (SaaS): This delivers a full application stack to the user. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the internet.

* Function as a Service (FaaS): allows customers to execute code in response to certain events.

* Container as a Service (CaaS): allows customers to deploy and manage containerized applications using container orchestration tools.

**Advantages**

Businesses, researchers, and individual users no longer have to be bound to the limitations of their hardware. With the rise of cloud computing, there are clear advantages to hosting your servers through a cloud platform.

* Scalability: Cloud platforms allow you to adjust your resources based on your needs. Gone are the days of having too much or too little resources for projects.

* Cost-Efficiency: Setting up an in-house server room can be expensive. With the initial cost of hardware, cost of electricity for both the servers and cooling, and the cost of maintenance are all taken away by cloud computing. Pay for what needs to be used, and nothing more resulting in savings.

* Innovation: Cloud platforms often provide tools and services to help facilitate the development of new applications such as AI, machine learning, and more.

* Flexibility & Mobility: Users can access their files and applications from anywhere globally, provided they have an internet connection.

* Disaster Recovery: Data is often backed up in multiple locations, ensuring recovery is possible in the event of a disaster.

**Disadvantages**

With advantages comes disadvantages. While cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses operate and innovate, there are also certain challenges and risks associated with its adoption. The main concern lies within data privacy and security, regardless of the expansive encryption and data security measures services provide.

* Dependence on Service Providers: Hosting on a cloud service means that your data, applications, and processes are at the providers mercy. If they face downtime or go out of business, this could disrupt your own business

* Cost overruns: Although cloud computing can be cost-effective, it is also very easy to rack up charges if usage is not monitored correctly.

* Limited control: There is simply less control over a cloud provider than to host in-house infrastructure. Clients have limited options and control over the underlying infrastructure, as it is managed by the provider.

* Performance: Cloud computing is heavily dependent on internet connectivity. Slow or unstable connections can hamper both access and performance.

**The Future of Cloud Computing**

With the rising popularity of generative AI and other machine learning applications, cloud computing is rapidly growing. One large step for cloud computing came in 2020 when the work from home model became more prevalent in businesses. The global market for cloud computing was valued at 569 Billion USD in 2022 and is expected to grow from 677 Billion USD in 2023 to 2.432 Trillion USD in 2030, showcasing a CAGR of 20.0% (Fortune Business Insights). The adoption of cloud computing allows businesses to cut down wasteful expenditures, as they will only use resources they need.

**Job Outlook**

With the rapid growth of the cloud computing market more job opportunities become available and in demand. Some of the positions include a cloud architect, engineer or developer who each have a role in designing, building, implementing, and improving the cloud infrastructure and the applications and services. Furthermore, the intricacies of cloud computing necessitate the emergence of specialized roles. Cloud security specialists, for instance, ensure that data and applications are protected against threats. Beyond the technical side, project managers, sales representatives, account managers and more specializing in cloud services are crucial for bridging the gap between the clients and the tech teams. Ultimately, with the exponential growth of the cloud computing industry, there are many opportunities becoming available to people who are already in or looking to get in the tech industry.

**Where does GIGO fit in?**
One thing [GIGO](http://gigo.dev) prides itself on is the approach for newcomers to pass through hurdles that can sometimes be discouraging or even lead to giving up. When users initiate a project on GIGO, they receive access to a DevSpace. This DevSpace is a ready-to-use environment, complete with a web-based VSCode editor. By offering these environments on GIGO’s infrastructure, we alleviate the often cumbersome process of environment setup and provide users with resources that may not be available on their own computers. GIGO aims to help newcomers jump into learning code as quickly as possible without getting discouraged by all of the setup and management experienced programmers are familiar with.
