## Who is GIGO?

In the fall of 2022, our foundational programmers embarked on a quest for inspiration. Driven by a shared desire to craft something cutting-edge but practical, they wanted to build something that they as developers felt passionate about during creation through completion. After a week-long deliberation process the 5 devs arrived at the concept of GIGO.

Envisioning an online haven where programmers could congregate, socialize, and wield their technical prowess, this initial spark set ablaze a much grander vision. GIGO, in the minds of the dynamic team, was destined as a place for programmers of all levels to learn and engage their skillset. A realm where beginners experience the fundamentals of coding, a playground for intermediates to hone their craft and forge connections, and a place for expert programmers to flex their vast expertise and give back to the community they had long been an integral part of. But this wasn’t enough, they sought to put a modern-day spin on it, it has to be fun, it has to feel like a game.

What makes programming fun? “Cool things are fun”. While simple, the statement rang true. What makes programming fun is understanding and partaking in the infinite number of technological advances as they occur. To transform an idea from concept into tangible reality, where the only limit on creation is the creator’s imagination. Humans found a way to manipulate rocks to think, and programmers give direction to their magic thinking rocks with complex ordering of 1’s and 0’s. The result being an ever configurable, infinitely malleable final product born in the cerebral of a lonely dev. What makes programming fun are the endless possibilities.

Thus, a core tenet of the platform was established: connect these technical thinkers, give them a safe-haven to create, share and receive feedback on their creation. All the while, reward them with practical experience and social gratification, providing genuinely fun and challenging projects to explore and complete.

There was intense discussion surrounding the name. What’s catchy, cool, and resonates with us as programmers? From the depths of his wrinkled brain, a dev brought forth “GIGO”. Garbage In — Garbage Out, an acronym recognized in the vocabulary of most programmers, it caught steam across the group and since its adoption has even garnered a mascot, the GIGO Gorilla.

After 6 months of dedicated work, the team, consisting of family & friends, introduced their brainchild to the world wide web with an official release. Patiently awaiting the world to discover their infant creation, the team is staying hard at work to bring more life to the platform, adding features — rounding out the UI & UX. The GIGO team hopes for widespread adoption, for people to explore the playground they meticulously crafted, a place of learning, connection, and endless possibilities.
