On Valentine’s day, I stumbled upon Madhur Behl, a computer science professor who studies artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles at the University of Virginia, leading the [Cavalier Autonomous Racing Team](https://autonomousracing.dev).

He expanded on the application of AI to high-speed motorsports and what that means for the average person in this [great article](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-02-ai-autonomous-auto-safer-driverless.html) detailing how autonomous auto racing, featuring driverless cars competing at high speeds, is advancing AI technology and making driverless cars safer for road use.

### History repeating itself

Professor Behl draws an intriguing parallel between the historical transition from horses to motorized vehicles and today’s shift towards autonomous cars. Sometimes technological advancement can be scary, especially when the leaps are so drastic. But it doesn’t have to be.

It’s not just about replacing the human driver but re-imagining mobility. If you had asked the average person what would make transportation easier in the 1800’s they would have told you they need a faster, or stronger horse.

Autonomous auto racing demonstrates how machines can outperform in tasks once deemed exclusive to human judgment and intuition. Akin to how motors replaced horses, Artificial Intelligence is stepping in to replace the human error aspect of the transportation equation.

### The checkered flag marking a new era

The creation and competition of autonomous race cars are far from being just an entertaining spectacle. These events represent a rigorous and invaluable testing ground where artificial intelligence systems are put through their paces.

Racing at high speeds requires split-second decision-making and precise control, challenging these systems to navigate complex environments and scenarios.

This competition was a display on how these cars can make those calls similar, if not better, than humans. By demonstrating their ability to handle these high-pressure situations, autonomous racing cars provide tangible proof of the potential for AI to improve road safety and efficiency.

### How do racing enthusiasts feel about being on the forefront?

Though tangential, I’ve had the opportunity to discuss these advances with some of my Formula1 fanatic friends. A diverse set of opinions, some of which coming from technical backgrounds, others not, there seems to be an even split.

The fans with racing in their blood recognize the inherent danger to drivers is part of what makes watching the races so exciting. Man vs. machine vs. the track. Pushing it to the limit for the sake of pushing it to the limit. That’s where the real thrill is.

On the other side of the isle, seeing mechanical excellence meet peak execution is absolutely riveting. Humans chase exceptionalism through excess, always looking to squeeze every drop out of whatever is handy.

If we have to take humans out of the equation to redline like never before — so be it.

### The final lap (in conclusion..)

As autonomous racing continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that this technology is not just about creating driverless cars; it’s about envisioning a future where transportation is safer, more efficient, and more accessible.

The lessons learned on the racetrack are directly influencing the development of consumer vehicles, bringing us closer to a world where autonomous cars are a common sight on our roads.
