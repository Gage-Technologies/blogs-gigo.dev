## Introduction

Let's get started with the Text-to-Speech Discord Bot tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll build a Discord bot that can convert text to speech using the ElevenLabs API. This bot will be able to join voice channels, convert text messages to audio, and play them in real-time.

You can launch this tutorial in a web-based VSCode editor in 1 click at [GIGO Dev](https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1831384939744985089). Your development environment will automatically be set up and the tutorial will be available in an interactive session inside the VSCode editor. You will also have access to AI learning tools to guide you through the tutorial. You can also check out all of the other learning material on GIGO Dev at [www.gigo.dev](https://www.gigo.dev).

The tutorial is structured into several parts:

1. Project Setup and Configuration
2. TTS Handler
3. Voice Handler
4. Discord Bot (Part 1)
5. Discord Bot (Part 2)
6. Deployment

First, we'll set up our project structure and create the configuration file. This will lay the foundation for our bot and ensure that we're following best practices for managing sensitive information and project configuration.

# Part 1: Project Setup and Configuration

## Open Your Editor

Open your code editor of choice. You can use any editor you like, but we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you don't have an editor installed, or you don't want to set up the development environment, you can use the web-based VSCode editor at [GIGO Dev](https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1831384939744985089).

## Project Structure

Let's start by creating the following project structure:

```
tts-discord-bot/
├── bot/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── tts_handler.py
│   └── voice_handler.py
├── config.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Create these files and directories in your project folder. We'll be filling them out as we progress through the tutorial.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

If you'd like to skip setting up the development environment, you can use [GIGO Dev](https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1831384939744985089) to run this tutorial for free in a Cloud Development Environment and a web based VSCode editor.

Before we start coding, let's set up our development environment:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Create a virtual environment for our project:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages (we'll create the requirements.txt file later):

```bash
pip install discord.py python-dotenv elevenlabs
```

## Creating the Configuration File

Now, let's create our `config.py` file. This file will handle loading environment variables and provide a centralized place for our configuration settings.

Open `config.py` and add the following code:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load environment variables from .env file
        load_dotenv()
        
        # Discord bot token
        self.DISCORD_TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')
        
        # ElevenLabs API key
        self.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY')
        
        # Validate required environment variables
        if not self.DISCORD_TOKEN:
            raise ValueError("DISCORD_TOKEN is not set in the environment variables")
        if not self.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY:
            raise ValueError("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables")
```

Let's break down this code:

1. We import the `os` module to interact with environment variables and the `load_dotenv` function from the `python-dotenv` library.

2. We define a `Config` class that will hold our configuration settings.

3. In the `__init__` method, we call `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from a `.env` file (we'll create this file soon).

4. We retrieve the `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from the environment variables using `os.getenv()`.

5. We add validation to ensure that the required environment variables are set. If they're missing, we raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.

## Creating the .env File

Now, let's create a `.env` file in the root of our project to store our sensitive information. This file should never be committed to version control.

Create a new file named `.env` and add the following content:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_discord_bot_token_here` with your actual Discord bot token, and `your_elevenlabs_api_key_here` with your ElevenLabs API key.

## Adding .env to .gitignore

To ensure that we don't accidentally commit our `.env` file to version control, let's create a `.gitignore` file in the root of our project:

```
# .gitignore
.env
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

This will prevent Git from tracking our `.env` file, virtual environment, and Python cache files.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've set up our project structure, created a virtual environment, and implemented a configuration system using environment variables. This approach allows us to keep sensitive information secure and provides a flexible way to manage our bot's configuration.

In the next tutorial, we'll implement the TTS handler, which will interact with the ElevenLabs API to generate speech from text.

Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created the project structure
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Implemented the `Config` class in `config.py`
4. Created a `.env` file for sensitive information
5. Added a `.gitignore` file to protect sensitive data

In the next part, we'll start implementing the core functionality of our Text-to-Speech Discord Bot.

# Part 2: Implementing the TTS Handler

In this part of the tutorial, we'll implement the Text-to-Speech (TTS) handler for our Discord bot. This handler will interact with the ElevenLabs API to generate speech from text. We'll create a `TTSHandler` class that encapsulates all the TTS-related functionality, making it easy to use in our main bot code.

## Creating the tts_handler.py File

First, let's create the `tts_handler.py` file in the `bot` directory. This file will contain our `TTSHandler` class and any related utilities.

Open `bot/tts_handler.py` and let's start implementing the class:

```python
import io
import logging
from elevenlabs import generate, set_api_key, Voice, VoiceSettings
from config import Config

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class TTSHandler:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config
        set_api_key(config.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
        self.voice = "Rachel"  # Default voice
        self.model = "eleven_multilingual_v2"
```

Let's break down this initial code:

1. We import the necessary modules, including `io` for handling byte streams, `logging` for error logging, and various components from the `elevenlabs` library.

2. We set up a logger for this module using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

3. We define the `TTSHandler` class, which takes a `Config` object as a parameter in its constructor.

4. In the `__init__` method, we store the config, set the API key using `set_api_key()`, and define default values for `voice` and `model`.

Now, let's add methods to our `TTSHandler` class for generating speech and managing voice settings:

```python
class TTSHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    async def generate_speech(self, text: str) -> io.BytesIO:
        """Generate speech from text using ElevenLabs API."""
        try:
            audio = generate(
                text=text,
                voice=self.voice,
                model=self.model
            )
            return io.BytesIO(audio)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error generating speech: {str(e)}")
            raise

    def set_voice(self, voice: str):
        """Set the voice to be used for TTS."""
        self.voice = voice

    def set_model(self, model: str):
        """Set the model to be used for TTS."""
        self.model = model

    def get_voice_settings(self, voice_id: str) -> VoiceSettings:
        """Get the default settings for a specific voice."""
        try:
            voice = Voice(voice_id=voice_id)
            return voice.settings
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting voice settings: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

Let's explain these methods:

1. `generate_speech(self, text: str) -> io.BytesIO`:
   - This asynchronous method takes a text input and generates speech using the ElevenLabs API.
   - It uses the current `voice` and `model` settings.
   - The generated audio is returned as a `BytesIO` object, which can be easily used for playback or saving.
   - We use a try-except block to catch and log any errors that occur during the API call.

2. `set_voice(self, voice: str)` and `set_model(self, model: str)`:
   - These methods allow us to change the voice and model used for speech generation.

3. `get_voice_settings(self, voice_id: str) -> VoiceSettings`:
   - This method retrieves the default settings for a specific voice.
   - It creates a `Voice` object with the given `voice_id` and returns its settings.
   - Error handling is implemented to catch and log any issues.

Now, let's add a method to create a custom voice with specific settings:

```python
class TTSHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    def create_custom_voice(self, voice_id: str, stability: float, similarity_boost: float) -> Voice:
        """Create a custom voice with specific settings."""
        try:
            settings = VoiceSettings(stability=stability, similarity_boost=similarity_boost)
            return Voice(voice_id=voice_id, settings=settings)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error creating custom voice: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

This `create_custom_voice` method allows us to create a `Voice` object with custom stability and similarity boost settings. These settings can be used to fine-tune the voice output.

Finally, let's add a method to clone a voice using audio samples:

```python
class TTSHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    async def clone_voice(self, name: str, description: str, files: list[str]) -> Voice:
        """Clone a voice using audio samples."""
        try:
            from elevenlabs import clone

            voice = clone(
                name=name,
                description=description,
                files=files,
            )
            return voice
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error cloning voice: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

The `clone_voice` method allows us to create a new voice based on audio samples. This can be useful for creating custom voices for specific users or characters.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've implemented the `TTSHandler` class, which encapsulates all the functionality needed to interact with the ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech conversion. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created the `TTSHandler` class with initialization for API key and default settings.
2. Implemented methods for generating speech, setting voice and model options.
3. Added functionality to get voice settings and create custom voices.
4. Implemented a method for cloning voices using audio samples.

Our `TTSHandler` class now provides a robust interface for working with the ElevenLabs API, handling errors, and managing different voice options.

In the next tutorial, we'll implement the `VoiceHandler` class, which will manage Discord voice channel connections and audio playback.

Here's the complete code for `tts_handler.py`:

```python
import io
import logging
from elevenlabs import generate, set_api_key, Voice, VoiceSettings, clone
from config import Config

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class TTSHandler:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config
        set_api_key(config.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
        self.voice = "Rachel"  # Default voice
        self.model = "eleven_multilingual_v2"

    async def generate_speech(self, text: str) -> io.BytesIO:
        """Generate speech from text using ElevenLabs API."""
        try:
            audio = generate(
                text=text,
                voice=self.voice,
                model=self.model
            )
            return io.BytesIO(audio)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error generating speech: {str(e)}")
            raise

    def set_voice(self, voice: str):
        """Set the voice to be used for TTS."""
        self.voice = voice

    def set_model(self, model: str):
        """Set the model to be used for TTS."""
        self.model = model

    def get_voice_settings(self, voice_id: str) -> VoiceSettings:
        """Get the default settings for a specific voice."""
        try:
            voice = Voice(voice_id=voice_id)
            return voice.settings
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting voice settings: {str(e)}")
            raise

    def create_custom_voice(self, voice_id: str, stability: float, similarity_boost: float) -> Voice:
        """Create a custom voice with specific settings."""
        try:
            settings = VoiceSettings(stability=stability, similarity_boost=similarity_boost)
            return Voice(voice_id=voice_id, settings=settings)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error creating custom voice: {str(e)}")
            raise

    async def clone_voice(self, name: str, description: str, files: list[str]) -> Voice:
        """Clone a voice using audio samples."""
        try:
            voice = clone(
                name=name,
                description=description,
                files=files,
            )
            return voice
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error cloning voice: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for handling text-to-speech functionality in our Discord bot. In the next part, we'll focus on managing Discord voice connections and audio playback.

# Part 3: Voice Handler Implementation

In this part of the tutorial, we'll implement the `VoiceHandler` class, which will manage Discord voice channel connections and audio playback. This handler will work in conjunction with our `TTSHandler` to enable our bot to join voice channels, play generated audio, and leave channels when requested.

## Creating the voice_handler.py File

Let's create the `voice_handler.py` file in the `bot` directory. This file will contain our `VoiceHandler` class and any related utilities.

Open `bot/voice_handler.py` and let's start implementing the class:

```python
import discord
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class VoiceHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.voice_clients = {}

    async def join_channel(self, channel: discord.VoiceChannel) -> discord.VoiceClient:
        """Join a voice channel."""
        try:
            voice_client = await channel.connect()
            self.voice_clients[channel.guild.id] = voice_client
            logger.info(f"Joined voice channel: {channel.name}")
            return voice_client
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error joining voice channel: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

Let's break down this initial code:

1. We import the necessary modules: `discord` for interacting with Discord's API and `logging` for error logging.

2. We set up a logger for this module using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

3. We define the `VoiceHandler` class with an `__init__` method that initializes an empty dictionary `voice_clients` to keep track of active voice connections.

4. The `join_channel` method is an asynchronous function that takes a `discord.VoiceChannel` as an argument and attempts to connect to it. If successful, it stores the `VoiceClient` in the `voice_clients` dictionary using the guild ID as the key.

Now, let's add methods for leaving a voice channel and playing audio:

```python
class VoiceHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    async def leave_channel(self, guild_id: int):
        """Leave the voice channel in the specified guild."""
        try:
            voice_client = self.voice_clients.get(guild_id)
            if voice_client:
                await voice_client.disconnect()
                del self.voice_clients[guild_id]
                logger.info(f"Left voice channel in guild {guild_id}")
            else:
                logger.warning(f"No voice client found for guild {guild_id}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error leaving voice channel: {str(e)}")
            raise

    async def play_audio(self, guild_id: int, audio_source: discord.AudioSource):
        """Play audio in the voice channel of the specified guild."""
        try:
            voice_client = self.voice_clients.get(guild_id)
            if voice_client:
                if voice_client.is_playing():
                    voice_client.stop()
                voice_client.play(audio_source)
                logger.info(f"Started playing audio in guild {guild_id}")
            else:
                logger.warning(f"No voice client found for guild {guild_id}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error playing audio: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

Let's explain these new methods:

1. `leave_channel(self, guild_id: int)`:
   - This method disconnects the bot from the voice channel in the specified guild.
   - It retrieves the `VoiceClient` from the `voice_clients` dictionary using the guild ID.
   - If a client is found, it disconnects and removes the entry from the dictionary.
   - If no client is found, it logs a warning.

2. `play_audio(self, guild_id: int, audio_source: discord.AudioSource)`:
   - This method plays audio in the voice channel of the specified guild.
   - It retrieves the `VoiceClient` from the `voice_clients` dictionary.
   - If a client is found, it stops any currently playing audio and starts playing the new audio source.
   - If no client is found, it logs a warning.

Now, let's add a utility method to check if the bot is in a voice channel:

```python
class VoiceHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    def is_in_voice_channel(self, guild_id: int) -> bool:
        """Check if the bot is in a voice channel in the specified guild."""
        return guild_id in self.voice_clients
```

This method allows us to quickly check if the bot is currently in a voice channel for a given guild.

Finally, let's add a method to create an audio source from bytes, which will be useful when working with our `TTSHandler`:

```python
import io
import discord

class VoiceHandler:
    # ... (previous code)

    def create_audio_source(self, audio_data: io.BytesIO) -> discord.AudioSource:
        """Create an AudioSource from bytes."""
        try:
            audio_data.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
            return discord.FFmpegPCMAudio(audio_data, pipe=True)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error creating audio source: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

This `create_audio_source` method takes a `BytesIO` object containing audio data (which we'll get from our `TTSHandler`) and creates a `discord.FFmpegPCMAudio` source that can be played in a voice channel.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've implemented the `VoiceHandler` class, which manages Discord voice channel connections and audio playback. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created the `VoiceHandler` class to manage voice connections across multiple guilds.
2. Implemented methods for joining and leaving voice channels.
3. Added functionality to play audio in voice channels.
4. Created utility methods for checking voice channel status and creating audio sources.

Our `VoiceHandler` class now provides a robust interface for managing Discord voice functionality, which we'll use in conjunction with our `TTSHandler` to create a fully functional Text-to-Speech Discord bot.

Here's the complete code for `voice_handler.py`:

```python
import discord
import logging
import io

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class VoiceHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.voice_clients = {}

    async def join_channel(self, channel: discord.VoiceChannel) -> discord.VoiceClient:
        """Join a voice channel."""
        try:
            voice_client = await channel.connect()
            self.voice_clients[channel.guild.id] = voice_client
            logger.info(f"Joined voice channel: {channel.name}")
            return voice_client
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error joining voice channel: {str(e)}")
            raise

    async def leave_channel(self, guild_id: int):
        """Leave the voice channel in the specified guild."""
        try:
            voice_client = self.voice_clients.get(guild_id)
            if voice_client:
                await voice_client.disconnect()
                del self.voice_clients[guild_id]
                logger.info(f"Left voice channel in guild {guild_id}")
            else:
                logger.warning(f"No voice client found for guild {guild_id}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error leaving voice channel: {str(e)}")
            raise

    async def play_audio(self, guild_id: int, audio_source: discord.AudioSource):
        """Play audio in the voice channel of the specified guild."""
        try:
            voice_client = self.voice_clients.get(guild_id)
            if voice_client:
                if voice_client.is_playing():
                    voice_client.stop()
                voice_client.play(audio_source)
                logger.info(f"Started playing audio in guild {guild_id}")
            else:
                logger.warning(f"No voice client found for guild {guild_id}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error playing audio: {str(e)}")
            raise

    def is_in_voice_channel(self, guild_id: int) -> bool:
        """Check if the bot is in a voice channel in the specified guild."""
        return guild_id in self.voice_clients

    def create_audio_source(self, audio_data: io.BytesIO) -> discord.AudioSource:
        """Create an AudioSource from bytes."""
        try:
            audio_data.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
            return discord.FFmpegPCMAudio(audio_data, pipe=True)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error creating audio source: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

In the next part of the tutorial, we'll start implementing the main bot functionality, integrating the `TTSHandler` and `VoiceHandler` classes we've created.

# Part 4: Main Bot Implementation (Part 1)

In this part of the tutorial, we'll start implementing the main functionality of our Text-to-Speech Discord bot. We'll create the bot instance, set up basic event handlers, and implement the join and leave commands. We'll also introduce the concept of Cogs in Discord.py, which will help us organize our bot's commands and event listeners.

## Creating the main.py File

Let's create the `main.py` file in the root directory of our project. This file will be the entry point for our Discord bot.

Open `main.py` and let's start implementing the bot:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import asyncio
import logging
from config import Config
from bot.tts_handler import TTSHandler
from bot.voice_handler import VoiceHandler

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Initialize bot with intents
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

# Load configuration
config = Config()

# Initialize handlers
tts_handler = TTSHandler(config)
voice_handler = VoiceHandler()

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    logger.info(f'{bot.user} has connected to Discord!')
```

Let's break down this initial code:

1. We import the necessary modules, including our custom `Config`, `TTSHandler`, and `VoiceHandler` classes.

2. We set up logging to help us debug and monitor our bot.

3. We initialize the bot with the required intents, including `message_content` to access message content.

4. We create instances of our `Config`, `TTSHandler`, and `VoiceHandler` classes.

5. We define an `on_ready` event handler to log when the bot has successfully connected to Discord.

Now, let's create a Cog to organize our voice-related commands:

```python
class VoiceCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.voice_handler = voice_handler

    @commands.command()
    async def join(self, ctx):
        """Join the user's voice channel."""
        if ctx.author.voice:
            channel = ctx.author.voice.channel
            try:
                await self.voice_handler.join_channel(channel)
                await ctx.send(f'Joined {channel.name}')
            except Exception as e:
                await ctx.send(f"An error occurred while joining the channel: {str(e)}")
        else:
            await ctx.send('You need to be in a voice channel to use this command.')

    @commands.command()
    async def leave(self, ctx):
        """Leave the current voice channel."""
        if self.voice_handler.is_in_voice_channel(ctx.guild.id):
            try:
                await self.voice_handler.leave_channel(ctx.guild.id)
                await ctx.send('Left the voice channel.')
            except Exception as e:
                await ctx.send(f"An error occurred while leaving the channel: {str(e)}")
        else:
            await ctx.send('I am not in a voice channel.')

# Add the Cog to the bot
async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(VoiceCog(bot))
```

Let's explain the `VoiceCog`:

1. We create a `VoiceCog` class that inherits from `commands.Cog`. This allows us to group related commands and event listeners.

2. In the constructor, we store references to the bot and the voice_handler.

3. We implement two commands: `join` and `leave`.

4. The `join` command checks if the user is in a voice channel, then uses the `voice_handler` to join that channel.

5. The `leave` command checks if the bot is in a voice channel, then uses the `voice_handler` to leave the channel.

6. We define an `setup` function that adds the `VoiceCog` to the bot. This will be called when we start the bot.

Now, let's modify our main bot code to load the Cog and start the bot:

```python
async def main():
    async with bot:
        await setup(bot)
        await bot.start(config.DISCORD_TOKEN)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This `main` function asynchronously sets up the bot, loads our `VoiceCog`, and starts the bot using the token from our configuration.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've set up the main structure of our Discord bot and implemented basic voice channel commands. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created the main bot file with necessary imports and initialization.
2. Set up logging for better debugging and monitoring.
3. Implemented the `on_ready` event handler.
4. Created a `VoiceCog` to organize voice-related commands.
5. Implemented `join` and `leave` commands using our `VoiceHandler`.
6. Set up the main function to start the bot and load the Cog.

Our bot can now connect to Discord and respond to basic voice channel commands. In the next tutorial, we'll implement the TTS command and integrate it with our `TTSHandler` to enable text-to-speech functionality.

Here's the complete code for `main.py`:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import asyncio
import logging
from config import Config
from bot.tts_handler import TTSHandler
from bot.voice_handler import VoiceHandler

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Initialize bot with intents
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

# Load configuration
config = Config()

# Initialize handlers
tts_handler = TTSHandler(config)
voice_handler = VoiceHandler()

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    logger.info(f'{bot.user} has connected to Discord!')

class VoiceCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.voice_handler = voice_handler

    @commands.command()
    async def join(self, ctx):
        """Join the user's voice channel."""
        if ctx.author.voice:
            channel = ctx.author.voice.channel
            try:
                await self.voice_handler.join_channel(channel)
                await ctx.send(f'Joined {channel.name}')
            except Exception as e:
                await ctx.send(f"An error occurred while joining the channel: {str(e)}")
        else:
            await ctx.send('You need to be in a voice channel to use this command.')

    @commands.command()
    async def leave(self, ctx):
        """Leave the current voice channel."""
        if self.voice_handler.is_in_voice_channel(ctx.guild.id):
            try:
                await self.voice_handler.leave_channel(ctx.guild.id)
                await ctx.send('Left the voice channel.')
            except Exception as e:
                await ctx.send(f"An error occurred while leaving the channel: {str(e)}")
        else:
            await ctx.send('I am not in a voice channel.')

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(VoiceCog(bot))

async def main():
    async with bot:
        await setup(bot)
        await bot.start(config.DISCORD_TOKEN)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In the next part of the tutorial, we'll implement the TTS command and integrate all the components we've built so far.

# Part 5: Main Bot Implementation (Part 2)

In this final part of our main bot implementation, we'll add the Text-to-Speech (TTS) command and integrate all the components we've built so far. We'll also implement commands to change voices and handle various error scenarios.

## Updating the main.py File

Let's update our `main.py` file to include the new TTS functionality. We'll create a new Cog for TTS-related commands.

Open `main.py` and add the following code after the `VoiceCog` class:

```python
class TTSCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.tts_handler = tts_handler
        self.voice_handler = voice_handler

    @commands.command()
    async def tts(self, ctx, *, text: str):
        """Convert text to speech and play it in the voice channel."""
        if not self.voice_handler.is_in_voice_channel(ctx.guild.id):
            await ctx.send('I need to be in a voice channel to use TTS. Use !join first.')
            return

        try:
            audio_stream = await self.tts_handler.generate_speech(text)
            audio_source = self.voice_handler.create_audio_source(audio_stream)
            await self.voice_handler.play_audio(ctx.guild.id, audio_source)
            await ctx.send('TTS message played successfully.')
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f'Error in TTS command: {str(e)}')
            await ctx.send('An error occurred while processing your TTS request.')

    @commands.command()
    async def set_voice(self, ctx, voice: str):
        """Set the voice to be used for TTS."""
        try:
            self.tts_handler.set_voice(voice)
            await ctx.send(f'Voice set to {voice}.')
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f'Error setting voice: {str(e)}')
            await ctx.send('An error occurred while setting the voice.')

    @commands.command()
    async def list_voices(self, ctx):
        """List available voices."""
        voices = ["Rachel", "Domi", "Bella", "Antoni", "Elli", "Josh", "Arnold", "Adam", "Sam"]
        voice_list = "\n".join(voices)
        await ctx.send(f'Available voices:\n{voice_list}')
```

Let's break down the new `TTSCog`:

1. The `tts` command:
   - Checks if the bot is in a voice channel.
   - Generates speech from the provided text using `tts_handler`.
   - Creates an audio source and plays it using `voice_handler`.
   - Handles potential errors and provides feedback to the user.

2. The `set_voice` command:
   - Allows users to change the voice used for TTS.
   - Uses the `set_voice` method from `tts_handler`.

3. The `list_voices` command:
   - Provides a list of available voices to the user.
   - Note: This is a simplified version. In a production bot, you might want to fetch this list dynamically from the ElevenLabs API.

Now, let's update the `setup` function to include our new `TTSCog`:

```python
async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(VoiceCog(bot))
    await bot.add_cog(TTSCog(bot))
```

## Implementing Error Handling

To make our bot more robust, let's implement some global error handling. Add the following code to the `main.py` file:

```python
@bot.event
async def on_command_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.CommandNotFound):
        await ctx.send("Command not found. Use !help to see available commands.")
    elif isinstance(error, commands.MissingRequiredArgument):
        await ctx.send("Missing required argument. Please check the command usage.")
    else:
        logger.error(f"An error occurred: {str(error)}")
        await ctx.send("An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.")
```

This error handler will:
- Inform users when they use a non-existent command.
- Notify users when they're missing required arguments for a command.
- Log unexpected errors and provide a generic message to the user.

## Updating the Bot's Status

Let's add a custom status to our bot to make it more informative. Update the `on_ready` event handler:

```python
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    logger.info(f'{bot.user} has connected to Discord!')
    await bot.change_presence(activity=discord.Game(name="!help for commands"))
```

This will set the bot's status to "Playing !help for commands", giving users a hint on how to interact with the bot.

## Final Touches

Let's add a simple help command override to provide more context for our custom commands. Add this to the `main.py` file:

```python
bot.remove_command('help')  # Remove the default help command

@bot.command()
async def help(ctx):
    """Display help information about the bot."""
    help_text = """
    **TTS Discord Bot Commands**
    
    `!join` - Join the user's voice channel
    `!leave` - Leave the current voice channel
    `!tts <text>` - Convert text to speech and play it
    `!set_voice <voice>` - Set the TTS voice
    `!list_voices` - List available TTS voices
    `!help` - Display this help message
    """
    await ctx.send(help_text)
```

## Conclusion

In this final part of our main bot implementation, we've added the core TTS functionality and several supporting features. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Implemented the `tts` command to convert text to speech and play it in voice channels.
2. Added commands to change and list available voices.
3. Implemented global error handling for better user experience.
4. Updated the bot's status to provide usage hints.
5. Created a custom help command to explain bot functionality.

Our Text-to-Speech Discord bot is now fully functional! Users can join voice channels, generate speech from text, change voices, and get help on how to use the bot.

Here's the complete final version of `main.py`:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

        await bot.start(config.DISCORD_TOKEN)

if __name__ == '__main__':

```

This completes the implementation of our Text-to-Speech Discord bot. In the next and final part of the tutorial, we'll cover how to run the bot, create a requirements.txt file, and provide some best practices for deployment and maintenance.

# Part 6: Finishing Touches and Deployment

In this final part of the tutorial, we'll cover the practical aspects of running and maintaining your Text-to-Speech Discord bot. We'll create a requirements.txt file, explain how to run the bot locally, and provide best practices for deployment and security.

## Creating the requirements.txt File

The `requirements.txt` file is crucial for managing your project's dependencies. It allows others (or yourself on a different machine) to easily install all necessary packages.

Create a new file named `requirements.txt` in your project's root directory and add the following content:

```
discord.py==2.3.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
elevenlabs==0.2.24
PyNaCl==1.5.0
```

These are the main dependencies for our project:
- `discord.py`: The Discord API wrapper we're using.
- `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- `elevenlabs`: The ElevenLabs API client for text-to-speech functionality.
- `PyNaCl`: Required for voice support in Discord.py.

To install these dependencies, you can run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Bot Locally

To run your bot locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Install the dependencies using the command mentioned above.
3. Set up your `.env` file with your Discord token and ElevenLabs API key:

   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the bot using the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

Your bot should now be online and ready to use in your Discord server!

## Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying your bot to a production environment, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use a production-ready web server**: For long-term hosting, consider using a service like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS EC2.

2. **Environment variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys and tokens. Never hard-code these values in your source code.

3. **Error logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging. You might want to use a service like Sentry for monitoring errors in production.

4. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting for commands to prevent abuse.

5. **Regular updates**: Keep your dependencies up-to-date, especially for security patches.

6. **Backup**: Regularly backup any persistent data your bot might store.

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: Never share your Discord token or ElevenLabs API key. If you suspect they've been compromised, regenerate them immediately.

2. **Permissions**: When adding your bot to a server, only request the permissions it actually needs.

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

4. **HTTPS**: If your bot interacts with any web services, ensure they use HTTPS.

## Potential Improvements and Extensions

1. **Multi-language support**: Implement support for multiple languages using ElevenLabs' multilingual model.

2. **User-specific voices**: Allow users to clone and use their own voices.

3. **Text streaming**: Implement streaming for long text inputs to reduce latency.

4. **Audio effects**: Add options for audio effects or filters to the TTS output.

5. **Integration with other services**: Consider integrating with services like Google Translate for translation capabilities.

6. **Web dashboard**: Create a web interface for managing bot settings and viewing usage statistics.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built a Text-to-Speech Discord bot using Discord.py and the ElevenLabs API. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished throughout this tutorial series:

1. Set up the project structure and configuration.
2. Implemented a TTS handler for interacting with the ElevenLabs API.
3. Created a voice handler for managing Discord voice connections.
4. Built the main bot functionality with commands for TTS, voice channel management, and more.
5. Implemented error handling and help commands.
6. Covered deployment best practices and security considerations.

Remember to keep your bot's code and dependencies up-to-date, and always prioritize the security of your users and your bot's access tokens.

Thank you for following this tutorial series. Happy coding, and enjoy your new Text-to-Speech Discord bot!
