## What is GIGO?

GIGO Dev is an online social programming platform containing a vast array of projects for programmers of all levels to compete and complete. A gamified learning experience, if you feel like you’re in a weird tech casino fever dream, you’re in the right place. GIGO was designed with the average video game experience in mind, users can earn XP, level up and increase rank — the experience is supposed to be equally fun as it is useful.

We support catalogues of projects for majority of the common industry used languages including but not limited to: Javascript, Python, Go, C++, C#, Rust, Kotlin, Typescript, and so on.

The platform is free to use, though there are some benefits that come with a pro membership. Pro users can run 3 concurrent DevSpaces, each of which have 6 CPU cores, 8GB of memory (RAM), and 50GB of disk space. Immense value stems from your own personal guide, Code teacher, the Magic programming tutor. Code teacher understands the code base of the GIGO Dev platform itself as well as each individual project, allowing users to ask direct questions related to their task at hand from inside the development environment. All programmers know Google search is their best friend whether they admit it or not, having a teacher built into the IDE to help guide you thru the knowledge gaps leads to an enriching educational experience.

When a user decides they want to try a project in GIGO Dev, with the click of a button we spin up a fully configured in browser [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) ([VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), allowing them to execute code almost immediately with low-to-no setup.

If you fit into one of the following categories you’ll likely resonate with GIGO’s mission and function:

A) You are a brand-new programmer, fresh out of online guided courses and looking for ideas/guidance for your very first post-course project.

B) You are an intermediate programmer with some reasonable accomplishments under your belt, you are gaining steam in your knowledge base and like what you do, and would be happy to find a place where you can express your skillset in a fun and friendly, yet competitive environment.

C) You are an expert programmer with decades of experience looking to showcase your vast expertise, maybe giving back to the community somewhere along the line by creating projects/challenges for the younger community to bang their heads on their monitor at.

Wherever you find yourself in your programming journey, there is a spot for you at [GIGO](http://gigo.dev) Dev to create, learn, and share experiences with like-minded individuals.
