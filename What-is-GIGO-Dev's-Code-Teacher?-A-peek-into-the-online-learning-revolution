Over the years public sentiment surrounding formal education has shifted. Where the world once viewed a degree as the guaranteed ticket to success, alternative avenues like certification, trade schools and self-taught skills are now commonly accepted credentials.

This has proven critical for those interested in computer science. With an intense desire to learn you can bypass expensive higher education, reaching proficiency in your subjects more quickly at a significantly lesser price point.

Whether you are specializing in a subject for a targeted role or seeking front-end, back-end or full stack experience, Code Teacher is custom built to help you achieve your subject matter expertise in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education and other online course based material.

### What is Code Teacher? Code Teacher is your personal AI tutor

Built by self-taught devs - for self taught devs. Code Teacher is the brain child of a team of programmers who wish they had more support during the early days of their learning journey.

The common format for self-taught programmers is to participate in a basic online course familiarizing themselves with the syntax of their new language. From there, they typically flock to reddit where they're overwhelmingly urged to start their first project - whatever that may be.

Code Teacher acts as a personal programming tutor, improving your ability to absorb and retain important information while learning to code like a developer.

Why do people use Code Teacher? Code Teacher makes understanding your code easier

GIGO Dev contains a collection of projects and programming tasks designed to teach proficiency. There will always be challenges and sticking points when learning something, Code Teacher is there to guide learners thru their hyper-specific problems. This is achieved thru a conversational chat interface. For example, look at the UI for our Word Reversal Mastery Byte below, Code Teacher's chat interface is outlined in red on the left hand side.

Lets crop out the editor UI to get a closer look at CT's messages.

Whenever a given task is started in GIGO, such as this word reversal Byte, Code Teacher opens the dialogue with a brief explanation of the task at hand. The chat is intended to be a conversation. We provide AI generated options to start the chat but you can type your own questions.

In the image above I asked Code Teacher to clarify what im working on. These are not pre-configured answers with a pre-configured path. Code Teacher has conversation capabilities and performs best when treated as a personal tutor in chat interface.

### How does Code Teacher benefit users? Code Teacher provides Code clean up, Debugging and next step suggestions

Once you understand and begin tackling your problem the chances of getting things exactly right the first try is low. CT steps up in a few different ways to guide you thru the task, promoting best practices for developers wanting to write clean, production-caliber code.

  1. What To Do Next: Many new developers get stuck and struggle with what to do next - CodeTeacher is here to help. With an intimate knowledge of your progress, your challenges and your code, answers can be given before questions are asked. A dynamic, reliable guiding hand when StackOverflow and Google provide no answers.

  2. Debug: Every step of development is riddled with roadblocks. CT is integrated at every junction, helpfully nudging users in the right direction. When an error occurs, CodeTeacher is there to highlight issues in the code with thought-provoking insight to the bug.

  3. Code Clean Up: A lot of developers know how to make their code work, but don't know how to make their code readable. To build real-world applicable skills, CodeTeacher teaches the developer how to write code that others can read. This is achieved by showing examples of a more efficient version of their code, teaching them proper coding procedures.

Code Teacher in GIGO Dev

Code Teacher is the pillar of GIGO's learn to code platform. Serving as a private tutor capable of conversational guidance throughout the learning process, Code Teacher gives suggestions for next steps, Debugging support, and Code Clean Up to help prospective coders learn real life development skills.

Instead of committing years of your time and tens of thousands of dollars to formal education, or months and hundreds of dollars to other online learn to code platforms, choose GIGO Dev to accelerate your learning process at an affordable rate - allowing you to achieve your goals in less time for a better price.
